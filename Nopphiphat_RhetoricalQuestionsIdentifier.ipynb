      "[{'file': '88_debate_1', 'content': 'LEHRER: Good evening. On behalf of the Commission on Presidential Debates I am pleased to welcome you to this first presidential debate of the 1988 campaign. I\\'m Jim Lehrer of the McNeil-Lehrer News Hour. My colleagues on the panel are John Mashek of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution; Ann Groer of The Orlando Sentinel; and Peter Jennings of ABC News. For the next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates for president of the United States following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two candidates. The candidates are Vice President George Bush, the Republican nominee; Governor Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee.\\n\\n(Applause)\\n\\nLEHRER: Our questions this evening will be about equally divided between foreign and domestic policy matters. The first question by agreement between the two candidates goes to Vice President Bush. It is a domestic question. You have two minutes for an answer, sir. The polls say the number one domestic issue to a majority of voters is drugs. What is there about these times that drives or draws so many Americans to use drugs?\\n\\nBUSH: I think we\\'ve seen a deterioration of values. I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned. For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think that\\'s all wrong. So we\\'ve seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools. We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing. And I don\\'t believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use. And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction. But we\\'ve got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes. We\\'ve got to get after the users more. We have to change this whole culture. You know, I saw a movie - \"Crocodile Dundee.\" And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident. And it\\'s bad. Everybody ought to be in this thing. Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education. And it isn\\'t a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem. But we have got to instill values in these young people. And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods. But I think we\\'re all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.\\n\\nLEHRER: Governor, you have one minute to respond.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important. But it\\'s important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top. That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves. Here we are with a government that\\'s been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator. We\\'ve been dealing with him; he\\'s been dealing drugs to our kids. Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences. I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor\\'s Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help. We\\'re providing that young woman with help. But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers. Values begin at the top, in the White House. Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.\\n\\nLEHRER: Governor, a follow-up question. You have two minutes to answer it. Are you suggesting, sir, that President Reagan is one of the causes of the drug problem in this country?\\n\\nDUKAKIS: I\\'m saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention. And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand. But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don\\'t understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it\\'s a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you. Now, I\\'ve outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together. But we also have to take demand seriously. You know, we have five percent of the world\\'s population in this country. We\\'re consuming 50 percent of the world\\'s cocaine. And in my state I\\'m proud to say we\\'ve organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country. We\\'re helping youngsters; we\\'re reaching out to them. And we\\'re beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that\\'s the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America. And we\\'ve got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances. I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country. If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don\\'t pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.\\n\\nLEHRER: A minute to rebut, Mr. Vice President.\\n\\nBUSH: Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA. I asked for and received the same briefing. I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information. And what I\\'m about to say is unclassified. Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega. It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice. And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him. And so I think it\\'s about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective. Panama is a friendly country. I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him. And we want to bring him to justice. And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.\\n\\nLEHRER: All right, the next question will be asked by John Mashek. It goes to Governor Dukakis, and you\\'ll have two minutes to answer.\\n\\nMASHEK: Governor Dukakis, another troublesome issue for voters this year is the bulging federal deficit. In a Dukakis administration, you say taxes will be raised only as a last resort. Would you identify for us then please three specific programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down?\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Yes, I\\'ve been very specific about those, John. And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that\\'s balanced ten budgets in a row, I\\'ve had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices. First, I\\'ve suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don\\'t need and we can\\'t afford. Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make. I\\'ve also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I\\'ve outlined those in detail. Secondly, we\\'ve got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country. Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit. Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down. And, finally, we\\'ve got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren\\'t being paid to this country. It\\'s very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected. I\\'ve also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts. We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we\\'ve been doing under this administration. We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again. The thing I don\\'t understand about Mr. Bush\\'s approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do. He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he\\'s against new taxes, although he\\'s broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break. He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs. If he keeps this up, he\\'s going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.\\n\\n(Laughter)\\n\\nDUKAKIS: But I hope you won\\'t take my five seconds away from me. I will say this -\\n\\nLEHRER: Your two minutes is up, Governor.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: If he\\'s serious about what he\\'s saying, then the only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the Social Security Trust Fund, and he tried that in 1985, and I think he\\'s going to try it again.\\n\\nLEHRER: You have a minute to rebut.\\n\\nBUSH: Is this the time to unleash our one-liners? That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor.\\n\\n(Laughter)\\n\\nBUSH: Let me help the governor. There are so many things there, I don\\'t quite know where to begin. When you cut capital gains, you put people to work. John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains. Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut. It\\'s not going to cost the government money. It\\'s going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it\\'s going to create jobs. So that\\'s one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us. Massachusetts doesn\\'t have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times. That happens to be a fact. And so let\\'s kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze. And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it\\'s good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.\\n\\nLEHRER: Your time is up, too. A follow-up, John.\\n\\nMASHEK: Mr. Vice President, you have vowed not to raise taxes of any kind during your administration and at the same time you\\'ve proposed this capital gains cut, you\\'ve proposed more incentive breaks for the oil industry. You\\'ve suggested new spending programs and even some Republicans say the flexible freeze you just spoke about will hardly make a dent in the deficit. Is the deficit no longer really a concern of yours, the Republican Party or the taxpayers?\\n\\nBUSH: I think it\\'s the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down. And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we\\'ve got to get the Democrats - Congress under control. They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime. I\\'d like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto. He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso. I would like a balanced budget amendment. But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years. So the problem is - it\\'s not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little. It is that we are continuing to spend too much. So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation. Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending. And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987. And if we - and the - actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending. Spending was only up something like 4 percent. So, it isn\\'t that we\\'re taking too little - from taxpayer - we\\'re spending too much still. And the formula I\\'ve given you works, we\\'ve put it through a good economic model, we\\'ve got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who\\'s a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts. And they agree, that if we can do what I\\'ve said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again. Capital gains, one more point on that, please let\\'s learn from history. A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.\\n\\nLEHRER: Governor, you have a minute to rebut.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully. What he\\'s proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we\\'re going to give to people making $200,000 a year. Why that\\'s more than the average teacher makes. We\\'ve had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen. We\\'ve run up more debt in the last eight years than under all the presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined. It\\'s time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.\\n\\nLEHRER: All right, the next question will be asked by Anne Groer and it will go the Vice President. You have two minutes to answer, sir.\\n\\nGROER: Mr. Vice President, you\\'ve said you want a kinder, gentler presidency, one that helps the less fortunate. Today, 37 million Americans including many working families with aging parents and young children cannot afford any health insurance, but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. What will you do to provide protection for them and how will you pay for it?\\n\\nBUSH: One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work. I want to keep this economic recovery going. More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force. What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid. I believe that\\'s the answer. I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill. And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we\\'re talking about here. But we\\'ve got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work. So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program. It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, \"We can\\'t make it.\" And I think then you\\'re going to see that people are put out of work. All these programs - and this cost on his - is - was - I saw an estimate, I\\'d love to know what he thinks, $35 - $40 billion - and it seems to me that somebody pays that. There isn\\'t any such thing as something free out there. It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete. So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system. I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance. I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience. It\\'s a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance. But I just don\\'t want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.\\n\\nLEHRER: A rebuttal, Governor?\\n\\nDUKAKIS: But, George, that\\'s no answer.\\n\\nBUSH: You don\\'t like the answer, but it\\'s an answer.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Well, no, it\\'s no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don\\'t have a dime of health insurance and don\\'t know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night. I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens, working citizens. All of them with little or no health insurance. One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance. Has an 11 year old son and can\\'t let that son compete in sports and Little League, because he\\'s afraid he\\'s going to get hurt and he won\\'t be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills. My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state. The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because they\\'re paying for those who aren\\'t. And I think it\\'s time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance. That\\'s the way we\\'re going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.\\n\\nLEHRER: Follow-up, Anne?\\n\\nGROER: Yes. Since your Massachusetts health plan has been attacked by the Vice President and you have defended it in this way, I would like to move on to perhaps one of the most costly medical catastrophes facing Americans today and that is AIDS. In - at the end of September, the thousands of AIDS patients will lose their access to AZT, which is the only Federally approved drug for treatment of the disease. Now, I\\'d like to now, sir, if - what your position is on extending that and what it is you think the government ought to be doing about making AZT and other drugs available to people who are suffering from this disease.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Well, Anne, let me just say before I answer your question that I didn\\'t know that the Vice President attacked our program in Massachusetts. I hope he hasn\\'t. Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think it\\'s a model for what I hope we can do across the country. But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine. The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it, don\\'t you? It was in 1964 and that\\'s what he called Medicare. Well, he was wrong then and he\\'s wrong now. (Applause)\\n\\nLEHRER: If I may interrupt at this point and caution the audience as I did before we went on the air, please hold it down. You\\'re only taking time away from your candidate when you do that. Governor, continue, please.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Let me say this about AIDS. It\\'s the single most important public health crisis, single most important public health emergency we\\'ve had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS. I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January. And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it\\'s appropriate and where it\\'s done carefully and responsibly. But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had. In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do. The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations. I think we\\'re both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.\\n\\nLEHRER: Mr. Vice President, a minute of rebuttal.\\n\\nBUSH: Well, we\\'re on the right track. The NIH is doing a good job in research. The Surgeon General is doing a good job in encouraging the proper kind of education. I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing. But we got to have a knowledge base. Testing should be confidential, but we have to have a knowledge. We can\\'t simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing. I\\'m Chairman of the President\\'s Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help. And you got to be careful here, because there\\'s a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we\\'ve got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure. We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature. So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.\\n\\nLEHRER: Next question will be asked by Peter Jennings. It goes to the Governor.\\n\\nJENNINGS: Good evening, Mr. Vice President, Governor. Governor, one theme that keeps coming up about the way you govern - you\\'ve both mentioned leadership tonight, so I\\'d like to stay with that for a second. The theme that keeps coming up about the way you govern is passionless, technocratic -\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Passionless?\\n\\nJENNINGS: Passionless, technocratic, the smartest clerk in the world. Your critics maintain that in the 1960\\'s your public passion was not the war in Vietnam or civil rights, but no fault auto insurance. And they say in the 1970\\'s you played virtually no role in the painful busing crisis in Boston. Given the fact that a president must sometimes lead by sheer inspiration and passion. We need to know if this is a fair portrait of your governing or if it is a stereotype. And if it isn\\'t fair, give us an example of where you have had that passion and leadership that sometimes a president needs?\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Peter, I care deeply about people. All people. Working people, working families. People all over this country who in some cases are living from paycheck to paycheck. In other cases are having a hard time opening up the door of college opportunity to their children. In other cases don\\'t have basic health insurance which, for most of us we accept as a matter of course, and assume we are going to have in order to pay the bills that we incur when we get sick. I\\'m somebody who believes deeply in genuine opportunity for every single citizen in this country and that\\'s the kind of passion I brought to my state. I was a leader in the Civil Rights movement in my state and in my legislature. I cared very deeply about that war in Vietnam...I thought it was a mistake, I thought it was wrong, and I was one of the few legislators early in that war that took a stand against the war. I think it was the right stand at that time and I think history has proved us to be correct. But I have learned over time. I served one term...I was defeated as you know, and defeat sometimes is an important lesson. I think I am a much better governor today...I think I am a much better person...a much better listener. I think I\\'ll be a much better president for having gone through that experience. But the things that we have done in my state to bring opportunity to people on public assistance -- over 50,000 families on welfare that we\\'ve helped to move from welfare to work and to become productive citizens -- the universal healthcare bill that we just talked about which will guarantee health care for all of our citizens. The opening up of opportunity to minorities in my state, affirmative action, minority contracting. The fact that we have a three percent unemployment rate and more jobs than people to fill them which gives us a tremendous opportunity to reach out to everybody and make them a part of this wonderful nation of ours with the opportunity that we create. These are things that I believe in very, very deeply. I may be a little calmer than some about it. I may be a greater consensus builder these days than I used to be, and I think that\\'s a good thing, but I\\'m running for the presidency of the United States. I\\'ve been in public service for 25 years because I believe deeply in American goals and values and the people of this country, and that\\'s the kind of president I want to be.\\n\\nLEHRER: Mr. Vice President, a rebuttal.\\n\\nBUSH: Well, I don\\'t question his passion. I question - and I don\\'t question his concern about the war in Vietnam. He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war. Now, that\\'s a certain passion that in my view it\\'s misguided passion. He - we have a big difference on issues. You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion. He said, \"I am a strong liberal Democrat\" - August, \\'87. Then he said, \"I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU.\" That was what he said. He is out there on out of the mainstream. He is very passionate. My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left. And I wish we had time to let me explain. But I salute him for his passion. We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.\\n\\n(Applause)\\n\\nLEHRER: Peter, a question? Question for the vice president, Peter.\\n\\nJENNINGS: I\\'d actually like to follow up if I may on this mention you\\'ve made of his card carrying membership in the American Civil Liberties Union. You\\'ve used the phrase \"card carrying\" so many times since Governor Dukakis first acknowledged that he was a card carrying member of the ACLU that some people have come to believe that you\\'ve used it to brand him in some way, to identify him as people were identified in the 1950\\'s as less than patriotic. I\\'d like to know why you keep repeating the phrase, and what\\'s the important issue here? What is so wrong with the governor being a member of an organization which has come to the defense of, among other people, Colonel Oliver North?\\n\\nBUSH: Nothings wrong with it. But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU. But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don\\'t like it when I say that he says he\\'s a card carrying member. Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here. I\\'ve seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I\\'ve done him an injustice, and he didn\\'t say it, I\\'m very, very sorry. But I don\\'t agree with a lot of - most of the positions of the ACLU. I simply don\\'t want to see the ratings on movies. I don\\'t want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie. I like those ratings systems. I don\\'t think they\\'re right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church. I don\\'t want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don\\'t want to see \"under God\" come out from our currency. Now, these are all positions of the ACLU. And I don\\'t agree with them. He has every right to exercise his passion, as what he said, a strong, progressive liberal. I don\\'t agree with that. I come from a different point. And I think I\\'m more in touch with the mainstream of America. They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance. You see, I\\'d have found a way to sign that bill. Governor Thompson of Illinois did. I\\'m not questioning his patriotism. He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism. And then all the liberal columnists join in. I am not. I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he\\'s coming from He has every right to do it. But I believe that\\'s not what the American people want, and when he said, when he said at the convention, ideology doesn\\'t matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years. And that\\'s all I\\'m trying to do, is put it in focus. And I hope people don\\'t think that I\\'m questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization.\\n\\nLEHRER: Governor, a response.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this. Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism. I don\\'t think there\\'s any question about that, and I resent it. I resent it. My parents came to this country as immigrants. They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world. I\\'m in public service because I love this country. I believe in it. And nobody\\'s going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly. The fact of the matter is if the Pledge of Allegiance was the acid test of one\\'s patriotism--the vice president\\'s been the presiding officer in the United States Senate for the past seven and a half years. To the best of my knowledge he\\'s never once suggested that a session of the Senate begin with the Pledge of Allegiance.\\n\\n(Applause)\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Mr. Bush, I don\\'t question your patriotism. When you\\'re attacked for your military record, I immediately said it was inappropriate, it had no place in this campaign, and I rejected it. I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment. Those are the concerns of the people that are watching us tonight. Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other\\'s patriotism and loyalty.\\n\\nLEHRER: The time is up, governor. Let\\'s go now to John Mashek, again. A question for the vice president.\\n\\nMASHEK: Mr. Vice President, in a debate during the Republican primaries, you said most of the nation\\'s homeless are suffering from mental illness, an assertion immediately challenged by one of your rivals. Estimates of the homeless range from a low of 250,000 by the government, to around three million, including working families and their children. What commitment are you willing to make tonight to this voiceless segment of our society?\\n\\nBUSH: I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded. I believe that that would help in terms of shelter. I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help. The governor\\'s wife has been very active in the homeless. My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Baker\\'s wife. This isn\\'t government. These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves. The government has a role. It is to fully fund the McKinney Act. There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it\\'s rough. And so I think that we\\'re on the right track. I don\\'t see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea. I see an involvement by a thousand points of light. I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill. They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work. And we\\'re on the track on this one. But - and I, look, mental - that was a little overstated it. I\\'d say around 30 percent. And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out. Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them. Because there is a major problem there. A lot of them are mentally sick. And we\\'ve got to attend to them. But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.\\n\\nLEHRER: Governor, a response.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don\\'t have health insurance. The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you\\'ve cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income. And when you do that, you\\'ve have homeless families. We didn\\'t have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago. We\\'ve got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy. We\\'ve got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can\\'t afford to live in the communities that they grew up in. That\\'s an essential commitment. And I think the housing community is ready. But it\\'s going to take a president who\\'s committed to housing, who\\'s had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream. And while I\\'m all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won\\'t do. We\\'ve got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I\\'m prepared to do so. This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country.\\n\\nLEHRER: John, a question for the governor.\\n\\nMASHEK: Governor, you\\'ve mentioned the American dream of home ownership, and it\\'s certainly become an impossible one for many of the young people of our nation who are caught up in this economic squeeze of the middle class, as you\\'ve said so frequently during the campaign. And yet in spite of your answer just a few minutes ago, what promise can you realistically hold out to these people that with the costs of housing going up, and with limited help available from Washington, are we destined to become a nation of renters?\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Well, I certainly hope not. And it\\'s all a question of what our priorities are. Mr. Bush talked about values. I agree with him. What are our values? Isn\\'t providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isn\\'t it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something that\\'s part of the American dream? I think so. You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didn\\'t sit around. We went out and built housing. The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing. Now, that\\'s the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States. This isn\\'t a question of a little charity for the homeless. This is a question of organizing the housing community. I\\'ve talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington. Washington, by itself, can\\'t do it all. We shouldn\\'t expect that. But governors are ready; mayors are ready. Builders and community leaders are ready. It will require some funds, John. And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds. But that, too, will require some choices. Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars. Well, that\\'s a choice we have to make, isn\\'t it? Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so. Because it\\'s so essential to our economic strength and to our future. Now, that\\'s the kind of presidency I believe in. And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesn\\'t do. We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue. It\\'s the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989.\\n\\nLEHRER: A response, Mr. Vice President.\\n\\nBUSH: I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless. Let\\'s talk about housing which the question was. When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House? Ten days before I took the oath of office as president they were 21 and a half percent. Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing? Housing is up. We are serving a million more families now. But we\\'re not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars. Go out and take a look at St. Louis at some of that effort. It is wrong. I favor home ownership. I want to see more vouchers. I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down. They\\'re half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, they\\'ll be a lot less. But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we\\'ll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.\\n\\nLEHRER: All right, the next question is to the governor. Ann Groer will ask it.\\n\\nGROER: Governor Dukakis, is there a conflict between your opposition to the death penalty and your support for abortion on demand, even though in the minds of many people, that\\'s also killing?\\n\\nDUKAKIS: No, I don\\'t think there is. There are two very different issues here, and they\\'ve got to be dealt with separately. I\\'m opposed to the death penalty. I think everybody knows that. I\\'m also very tough on violent crime. And that\\'s one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America. It\\'s one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country. It\\'s one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States. You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute. The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with. I don\\'t favor abortion. I don\\'t think it\\'s a good thing. I don\\'t think most people do. The question is who makes the decision. And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.\\n\\nLEHRER: Response, Mr. Vice President.\\n\\nBUSH: Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique. It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole. The federal program doesn\\'t do that. No other state programs do that. And I favor the death penalty. I know it\\'s tough and honest people can disagree. But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life. And I do believe it would be inhibiting. And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland. Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didn\\'t want him to be furloughed again. And so we have a fundamental difference on this one. And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life. I favor adoption. I do not favor abortion.\\n\\nLEHRER: Question for the vice president, Ann?\\n\\nGROER: Yes. Mr. Vice President, I\\'d like to stay with abortion for just a moment if I might. Over the years you have expressed several positions, while opposing nearly all forms of government payment for it. You now say that you support abortion only in cases of rape, incest, or threat to a mother\\'s life, and you also support a constitutional amendment that if ratified would outlaw most abortions. But if abortions were to become illegal again, do you think that the women who defy the law and have them anyway, as they did before it was okayed by the Supreme Court, and the doctors who perform them should go to jail?\\n\\nBUSH: I haven\\'t sorted out the penalties. But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion. And I favor adoption. And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved. And you see, yes, my position has evolved. And it\\'s continuing to evolve, and it\\'s evolving in favor of life. And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother. Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it\\'s much clearer for me now. As I\\'ve seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes. See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion. We certainly do. But no, I\\'m for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course there\\'s got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.\\n\\nLEHRER: Governor.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he\\'s prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision. It\\'s as simple as that. I don\\'t think it\\'s enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven\\'t sorted it out. This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make. And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he\\'s prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.\\n\\nBUSH: I just -\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Let me finish. Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think that\\'s the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have. I respect his right to disagree with me. But I think it\\'s important that we have a position, that we take it, and we state it to the American people.\\n\\nLEHRER: Peter Jennings, a question for the vice president.\\n\\nJENNINGS: Mr. Vice President, I\\'m struck by your discussion of women and the sanctity of life. And it leads me to recall your own phrase, that you are haunted by the lives which children in our inner cities live. Certainly the evidence is compelling. There\\'s an explosion of single parent families. And by any measure, these single parent families, many with unwanted children, are the source of poverty, school drop outs, crime, which many people in the inner city simply feel is out of control. If it haunts you so, why over the eight years of the Reagan-Bush administration have so many programs designed to help the inner cities been eliminated or cut?\\n\\nBUSH: One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you\\'re talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs. But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible. That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program. I do strongly support the WIC program. I think it is good. I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we\\'re going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these. But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things. The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I\\'m talking about in terms of education. I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that\\'s why I\\'m a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day. I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods. And so it\\'s a combination of these things. But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light. The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty. I\\'m for Head Start and moving that up. And I\\'ve already made a proposal - and yes, it will cost some money. But I favor that. So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don\\'t think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.\\n\\nLEHRER: Governor.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president\\'s been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives. It\\'s cut federal aid to education; it\\'s cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country. And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me. Let me just give you one other example. We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country. The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient. It\\'s taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and they\\'re still resisting. That\\'s the way you help people. Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I don\\'t know what that means. I know what strong political leadership is. I know what\\'s happened over the course of the past eight years. These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered, and they\\'ve hurt kids all over this country.\\n\\nLEHRER: A question for the governor, Peter.\\n\\nJENNINGS: Governor, the crisis is no less a crisis for you if you are elected president. Where would you get the money to devote to the inner cities which is clearly needed. And can you be specific about the programs not only you\\'d reinstate, but the more imaginative ones that you\\'d begin.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time. Welfare reform is one way to do it. If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don\\'t lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.\\n\\nThat\\'s just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time. In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely. One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance. Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can\\'t play little league ball that he can\\'t go out on the ball field because he\\'s afraid he\\'s going to get hurt.\\n\\nAnd yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don\\'t think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.\\n\\nSo these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives. Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us. I know the private sector is. People are all over the country. But it takes presidential leadership. It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading. And that\\'s the kind of presidency I want to lead.\\n\\nLEHRER: Mr. Vice President.\\n\\nBUSH: What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems, the man has just said he doesn\\'t understand what I\\'m talking about.\\n\\nThis is the problem I have with the big spending liberals. They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all. The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up. It is not down.\\n\\nBut here\\'s the point he misses. The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I\\'m talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature--are putting up 93 percent.\\n\\nBut the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better. We\\'re putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should. We\\'ve gotten away fro values and the fundamentals. And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence.\\n\\nAnd we can do it. But it¬πs not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nLEHRER: All right, let\\'s move now to some questions on foreign and national security policy. John Mashek will ask the first question of the governor.\\n\\nMASHEK: Governor, the vice president continually refers to your lack of experience, weakness, naivete on foreign policy and national security matters. He says you are prepared to eliminate weapons system that will result in the unilateral disarmament of this country. Is that true?\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Of course not. Of course that\\'s a charge that\\'s always made against any governor who runs for the presidency. I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980. Remember that, George? And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors‚ÄîFranklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.\\n\\nIts not the amount of time you spend in Washington. It\\'s not the length of your resume. It\\'s your strength, it\\'s your values, it\\'s the quality of the people you pick. It\\'s your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you\\'re in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us.\\n\\nThe vice president has a long resume. But it didn\\'t stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah. And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it.\\n\\nHis experience didn\\'t prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama.\\n\\nHe went to Philippines in the early 80¬πs and commended Ferdinand Marcos for his commitment to democracy. And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region.\\n\\nSo I don\\'t believe that the fact you\\'ve got that long resume or had that experience is the real question. The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided. I\\'m ready to provide that leadership. I want to be the commander in chief of this country. I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros. But I don\\'t think it\\'s just experience that makes the difference. It\\'s strength; it\\'s values.\\n\\nLEHRER: Mr. Vice President.\\n\\nBUSH: Well, I thought the question was about defense. The governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the West. And because we didn\\'t listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age. Now, we\\'re sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms, and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability. That is not the way you deal with the Soviets. I\\'ve met Mr. Gorbachev. Met Mr. Shevardnadze and talked substance with him the other day. These people are tough. But now we have a chance. I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.\\n\\nAnd now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don\\'t want to see us return to those days.\\n\\nAs to Ferdinand Marcos, he isn\\'t there any more. It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in. But I\\'ll tell you what I was thinking of. I flew a combat mission, my last one was over Manila. And he was down there fighting against imperialism. And he had just‚Äî\\n\\nLEHRER: Mr. Vice President\\n\\nBUSH: And he just lifted martial law. And he just called for new elections. And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy. And out he goes.\\n\\nLEHRER: Mr. Vice President, your time is up. John, a question for the vice president.\\n\\nMASHEK: Mr. Vice President, the governor has suggested that you\\'ve never met a weapons system that you didn\\'t like or want. Are you prepared to tell the voters one system in this time of tight budgetary restraints and problems at the Pentagon that you\\'d be willing to cut or even eliminate that wouldn\\'t endanger national security?\\n\\nBUSH: I don\\'t think it\\'s a question of eliminating. I can tell him some I\\'m against. A-6F, for example. DIVAD. And I can go on and on. Minuteman III, penetration systems. I mean, there\\'s plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I\\'m not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game. I\\'m simply not going to do that.\\n\\nAnd under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is. We\\'re going to have to‚Äîthe MX. We\\'re going to have to do that. It\\'s Christmas.\\n\\n(Laughter)\\n\\nBUSH: Wouldn\\'t it be nice to be perfect?\\n\\nDUKAKIS: I hope it isn\\'t Christmas when you make that decision.\\n\\nBUSH: wouldn\\'t it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake? These are the‚Äîmy answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.\\n\\nOf course we\\'re going to have to make some determination on this, and we\\'re going to have to make it on the convention forces. But now we\\'ve got a very good concept called competitive strategies. We will do what we do best. It\\'s a strategy that we\\'ve been working on for a couple of years. It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces.\\n\\nBut look, let me sum it up. I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance. I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth. But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start. And I think I\\'ve had that.\\n\\nLEHRER: Governor?\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Well, first let me say with respect to the freeze, that back in the spring of 1982 Mr. Bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today. As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world. I didn\\'t hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do.\\n\\nBut I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country. We\\'ve piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices.\\n\\nMr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars. He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons system we don\\'t need and can\\'t afford. I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman. I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely. But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make.\\n\\nI\\'m for the Stealth, I\\'m for the D-5, I\\'m for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile. But I don\\'t think we need these other systems. I don\\'t think we need them to remain strong. We\\'ve got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.\\n\\nLEHRER: Anne Groer, a question for the Vice President.\\n\\nGROER: Well, Mr. Vice President, you said you\\'ve met with Secretary General Gorbachev, you\\'ve met with Mr. Shevardnadze, but for the last forty years Americans have been taught to regard the Soviet Union as the enemy. Yet, President Reagan has signed two arms control treaties and he\\'s promised to share Star Wars technology with the very country he once called the evil empire. So, perhaps you can tell us this evening, should we be doing a lot to help the economics and the social development of a country that we have so long regarded as an adversary?\\n\\nBUSH: What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open. Be cautious. Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet. Yes, I think it\\'s fine to do business with them. And, so, I\\'m encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off.\\n\\nAnd when they have a --they a --deals that are good for us, as China started to do--the changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is absolutely amazing, in terms of incentive, in partnership and things of this nature. And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path. We should encourage that. We ought to say this is good.\\n\\nBut where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority. I\\'m not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment.\\n\\nAnd the interesting place‚Äîone of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe. You see the turmoil in Poland today. And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade. I don\\'t want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets. We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did. But this is an exciting time. But all I\\'m suggesting is let\\'s not be na√Øve in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid.\\n\\nLook at the INF treaty. And if we haven\\'t learned from the negotiating history on that, we\\'ll never learn. The freeze people were wrong. The Reagan-Bush administration was right.\\n\\nLEHRER: Governor Dukakis.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: It was a very different George Bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today. And you were right then, George, when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery. Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not. What we\\'re talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces. And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously.\\n\\nWe have serious differences with the Soviet Union. We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about. But there are opportunities there now. Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990¬πs and beyond. Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.\\n\\nAnd we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home. Let\\'s not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand. We cannot be strong militarily when we\\'re teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years. That\\'s why we need a Democratic administration in Washington in 1989.\\n\\n(Applause)\\n\\nLEHRER: Anne Groer, a question for the Governor.\\n\\nGROER: Yes. Governor Dukakis, speaking of seeming changes of position, you have gone from calling the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, a fantasy and a fraud, to saying recently that you would continue SDI research and might even deploy the system if Congress supported such a move. Why the change of heart?\\n\\nDUKAKIS: No, there\\'s been no change of heart. I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, that\\'s about a billion dollars a year. But I don\\'t know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack. It makes real sense. And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983.\\n\\nSo, I\\'m for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces. Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, ¬≥Well, if we continue with Star War‚ÄîStar Wars‚Äîwe have to cut some place.¬≤ He hasn\\'t told us where. We know where they\\'re cutting. We know where you\\'re cutting right now. You\\'re cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces. You\\'re cutting back on maintenance and equipment.\\n\\nAn Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we\\'d have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can\\'t drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don\\'t have enough fuel. Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling. They\\'re supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs, because they don\\'t have enough fuel.\\n\\nYou have to make choices. We\\'re not making those choices. And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately‚Äîon Star Wars‚Äîin my judgment makes no sense at all. We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent. We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over. They have about 12,000. So, we\\'ve got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down.\\n\\nBut to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks. That\\'s‚Äîat least that\\'s what I read. Maybe he\\'ll tell us where he stand on it tonight.\\n\\nLEHRER: Mr. Vice President.\\n\\nBUSH: I\\'m not reconsidering my position. Two questions: How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend‚Äîwilling to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud. Those are two hypo-rhetorical questions.\\n\\nHe is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battle groups. The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready. Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high. And secondly, in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard, the Democratic controlled Congress, so please help us with that, who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics.\\n\\n(Applause)\\n\\nBUSH: He\\'s got to get this thing more clear. Why do you spend a billion dollars on something you think is a fantasy and a fraud? I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can. We\\'ve set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it. That is my position on SDI and it\\'s never wavered a bit.\\n\\nLEHRER: Peter Jennings, a question for Governor Dukakis.\\n\\nJENNINGS: Well, Governor, and Vice President Bush, you\\'ve both talked tonight about hard choices. Let me try to give you one. Somewhere in the Middle East tonight, nine Americans are being held hostage. If you are commander-in-chief and Americans are held hostage, what will be more important to you, their individual fate, or the commitment that the United States Government must never negotiate with terrorists. And if any Americans are held hostage and you become president, to what lengths would you go to rescue them?\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Peter, it\\'s one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make. These are American citizens, we care deeply about them. Their families care deeply about them, want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back.\\n\\nBut if there\\'s one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever. Because if you do, it\\'s an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us. And that\\'s the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers. And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we\\'ve ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know.\\n\\nSo, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do it\\'s an open invitation to others to do the same. We\\'ve got to be tough on international terrorism. We\\'ve got to treat it as international crime. We\\'ve got to attack at all points, we\\'ve go to use undercover operations. We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they\\'re working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.\\n\\nYes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions. That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.\\n\\nLEHRER: Mr. Vice President?\\n\\nBUSH: I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government. It is the best anti-terrorist report written. Yes, we shouldn\\'t trade arms for hostages. But we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism. Now, it\\'s fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored‚Äîfingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya. And my opponent was unwilling to support that action.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: That\\'s not true. That\\'s not true.\\n\\nBUSH: And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: That\\'s not true.\\n\\nBUSH: And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other matter. And I\\'ve said mistakes were made. Clearly nobody\\'s going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages. That is a very serious charge against the president. The matter has been thoroughly looked into. But the point is sometimes the action‚Äì\\n\\n(Laughter)\\n\\nBUSH: ‚Äì has to be taken by the Federal Government and when we took action, it had a favorable response.\\n\\nLEHRER: A question for the Vice President. Peter?\\n\\nJENNINGS: It seems perhaps a good subject, Mr. Vice President, on which to make the point that you\\'ve campaigned vigorously as part of a leadership team. But so far you won\\'t tell the American people in considerable measure what advice you gave the president, including the sale of arms to Iran and what should have been done about the hostages. To the best of my knowledge there\\'s no Constitutional requirement which prevents you from doing so. Jimmy Carter urged his Vice President, Walter Mondale, to tell the American people. Would you now ask President Reagan for permission to tell the American people what advice you did give him? And if you don\\'t, how do we judge your judgment in the Oval Office in the last eight years?\\n\\nBUSH: You\\'re judged by the whole record. You\\'re judged by the entire record. Are we closer to peace? Are we doing better in anti-terrorism? Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf or in spite of the mistakes of the past, are we doing better there? How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf. Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace? You judge on the record. Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan? How does it look in a program he called or some one of these marvelous Boston adjective up there and‚Äîabout Angola‚Äînow, we have a chance‚Äîseveral Bostonians don\\'t like it, but the rest of the country will understand.\\n\\n(Applause)\\n\\nBUSH: Now we have a chance. Now we have a chance. And, so, I think that I\\'d leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record. And let me say this‚Äîall he can talk about‚Äîhe goes around ranting about Noriega. Now, I\\'ve told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that. He can talk about Iran/Contra and also‚ÄîI\\'ll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.\\n\\n(Applause)\\n\\nBUSH: I still have a couple of minutes left. And there is a difference principle ‚Äì\\n\\nLEHRER: Sorry, Mr. Vice President.\\n\\nBUSH: It\\'s only on yellow here. Wait a minute.\\n\\n(Laughter)\\n\\nLEHRER: I\\'m wrong. Go ahead. My apologies.\\n\\nBUSH: Jim ‚Äì\\n\\nLEHRER: You said nobody\\'s perfect.\\n\\nBUSH: I said I wasn\\'t perfect. Where was I?\\n\\nDUKAKIS: 25th of December, Mr. Vice President.\\n\\n(Laughter)\\n\\nBUSH: I finished.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: He can have another ten seconds if he wants, Jim.\\n\\nLEHRER: Governor, you have a minute to respond.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Well, the matter of judgment is very important. And I think it\\'s important to understand what happened here.\\n\\nA report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism. They were ignored. The Vice President ignored them. He says mistakes were made. Very serious mistakes in judgment were made. He says, ¬≥Well, let\\'s concede that the administration has been doing business with Noriega. Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers.¬≤\\n\\nI think those are very very serious questions of judgment, which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to judge and review. We\\'re not going to make those kinds of mistakes. You cannot make concessions to terrorists. If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages. That\\'s a basic principle. It was ignored in that case and it was a very very serious mistake in judgment.\\n\\nLEHRER: A question from John Mashek. It goes to the Vice President.\\n\\nMASHEK: Mr. Vice President, Democrats and even some Republicans are still expressing reservations about the qualifications and credentials of Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana, your chosen running mate, to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. What do you see in him that others do not?\\n\\n(Laughter)\\n\\nBUSH: I see a young man that was elected to the Senate twice, to the House of Representatives twice. I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30¬πs and 40¬πs. I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training Partnership Act and that retrains people in this highly competitive changing society we\\'re in, so if a person loses his hob he is retrained for a benefit‚Äîfor a‚Äìwork that will be productive and he won\\'t have to go on one of these many programs that the liberal‚Äîtalking about.\\n\\nI see a young man who is a knowledgeable‚Äîin defense and there are three people on our ticket that are knowledgeable‚Äîin the whole‚Äîin the race‚Äîknowledgeable in defense and Dan Quayle is one of them and I am one of them. And I believe that he will be outstanding. And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding. And I\\'d like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal. And he\\'s kept his head up. And he will do very very well. And he has my full confidence and he\\'ll have the confidence of people that are in their 30¬πs and 40¬πs and more. So, judge the man on his record not on the‚Äîlot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.\\n\\nMy opponent says J. Danforth Quayle. Do you know who J. Danforth was, he was a man who gave his life in World War II, so ridiculing a person\\'s name is a little beneath this process. And he\\'ll do very well when we get into the debates.\\n\\n(Applause)\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal. I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.\\n\\n(Applause)\\n\\nBUSH: Just the facts.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: But did I‚Äîdid I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket?\\n\\nBUSH: No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency. I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned. Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.\\n\\nI doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job. And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.\\n\\nLEHRER: John will ask a question of the Governor. It will be the last question and then the Vice President will have a rebuttal.\\n\\nMASHEK: Well, Governor, you did select Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.\\n\\nDUKAKIS: I did indeed.\\n\\nMASHEK: And you have a lot of disagreement with him on fundamental issues, including the Reagan tax cuts, aid to the rebels in Nicaragua, the death penalty, gun control. Who\\'s right?\\n\\n(Laughter)\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Well, John, I\\'m a man that\\'s been a chief executive for ten years. I\\'ve picked a lot of people. I\\'ve picked cabinets. I\\'ve named judges. I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards. I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they don\\'t, they don\\'t stick around very long.\\n\\nBut I didn\\'t pick Lloyd Bentsen because he was a clone of Mike Dukakis. I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President. Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, ¬≥Mr. President, that\\'s wrong. We shouldn\\'t do that.¬≤ That\\'s the kind of Vice President I want.\\n\\nHe, himself, has said, and rightly so, that he\\'ll be a strong Vice President. When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision. And I\\'m very very proud of that choice. And I didn\\'t pick him because he agreed with me on everything.\\n\\nYou know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking. The fact is I\\'ve picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership. I doubt very much. I doubt very much that Mr. Bush\\'s selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.\\n\\n(Applause)\\n\\nLEHRER: Mr. Vice President?\\n\\nBUSH: Well, I‚Äîwe obviously have a difference. I believe it does meet the test. We\\'ll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum, wonderful friendly fashion like this.\\n\\n(Laughter)\\n\\nBUSH: I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening. I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him. But now we\\'ve got the lines too carefully drawn here. But you talk about judgment. I mean, what kind of judgment‚ÄîI mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy. What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser now in jail in Massachusetts? I mean, there\\'s‚ÄîI don\\'t think this is a fair argument. But nevertheless, I support my nominee for Vice President and he\\'ll do an outstanding job.\\n\\nLEHRER: Gentlemen, I was given some bad word a moment ago. There is time for one more question. Getting it in my ear and Ann Groer will ask it. Ann? To the Governor.\\n\\nGROER: Governor Dukakis, as many U.S. farmers face or undergo foreclosure, the United States is considering the possibility of forgiving a certain percentage of debt owed by Latin American and Third World countries, do you favor giving these countries a break in their loans and, if so, how do you explain that to the American farmers who are losing their land and livelihood?\\n\\nDUKAKIS: Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we\\'ve got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently‚Äîwhich they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don\\'t do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we\\'ll destroy their economies, destroy their future. And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers.\\n\\nBut I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn\\'t cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it\\'s been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration. I think it\\'s going to require good, solid credit policies. And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.\\n\\nI think it\\'s going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time. Bio-degradable plastics‚Äîplastic‚Äîgasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products. I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.\\n\\nBut I don\\'t think there\\'s anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time.\\n\\nLEHRER: Mr. Vice President?\\n\\nBUSH: I oppose supply management and production controls. I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction. I want to expand our markets abroad and that\\'s why I\\'ve called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.\\n\\nI will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country. I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I\\'m optimistic about the agricultural economy.\\n\\nIn terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan. I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding. And I don\\'t want to see the banks let off the hook. I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged. But let\\'s not go back to that‚Äîwhat they call supply management and production control, that\\'ll simply price us out of the international market. Let\\'s try to expand our markets abroad.\\n\\nLEHRER: All right. That really is the end. Now, let\\'s go to closing statements. They will be two minutes each in duration by agreement. Vice President Bush goes first. Governor Dukakis second. Mr. Vice President.\\n\\nBUSH: I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and on ethics and energy and how we do better in battling crime in our country. But there are two main focal points of this election. Opportunity and peace.\\n\\nI want to keep this expansion going. Yes, we want change but we are the change. I am the change. I don\\'t want to go back to malaise and misery index. And, so, opportunity. Keep America at work. The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector. And in terms of peace, we are on the right track. We\\'ve achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible and I want to build on it. I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.\\n\\nI want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces. And then it gets down to a question of values. We\\'ve had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing. And I do favor the death penalty. And we\\'ve got a wide array of differences on those. But in the final analysis‚Äîin the final analysis, the person goes into that voting booth, they\\'re going to say, ¬≥Who has the values I believe in? Who has the experience that we trust? Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done?¬≤ My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support. Thank you very much.\\n\\n(Applause)\\n\\nDUKAKIS: This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family. We\\'ve had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you. I\\'m more optimistic today than I was when I began about this nation providing we have the kind of leadership in Washington that can work with you, that can build partnerships, that can build jobs in every part of this country, not certain parts of this country.\\n\\nYou know, my friends, my parents came to this country as immigrants like millions and millions of Americans before them and since, seeking opportunities, seeking the American dream. They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world, that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them.\\n\\nI believe in the American dream. I\\'m a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land, with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country. With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America. With decent and affordable healthcare for all working families.\\n\\nYes, it\\'s a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but it¬πs not an insolvable problem. It\\'s one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that\\'s strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we\\'re true to our values.\\n\\nWe have an opportunity working together to build that future, to build a better America, to build a best America, because the best America doesn\\'t hide. We compete. The best America. We invest. The best America doesn\\'t leave some of its citizens behind. We live‚Äîwe bring everybody along. And the best America is not behind us. The best America is yet to come. Thank you very much.\\n\\n(Applause)'}, {'file': '80_debate_2', 'content': 'RUTH J. HINERFELD, CHAIR, LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS EDUCATION FUND: Good evening. I\\'m Ruth Hinerfeld of the League of Women Voters Education Fund. We\\'re pleased to be in Baltimore for the first of our 1980 Presidential Debates. The League is a non-partisan organization. We\\'re presenting these debates to provide citizens an opportunity to see and hear the candidates state their positions on important issues of concern to us all. Our moderator is Bill Moyers.\\n\\nMR. MOYERS, HOST AND EXECUTIVE EDITOR, \"BILL MOYERS\\' JOURNAL,\" PUBLIC BROADCASTING SYSTEM: Thank you, Mrs. Hinerfeld. My colleagues and I agreed to participate tonight, although the questioners are limited by the constraints of the format, because we thought with the League of Women Voters, that it is desirable to seek a comparison of views on a few issues in a joint appearance by the men who would be the next President of the United States.\\n\\nFormer Governor Ronald Reagan, a Republican Party candidate, and Congressman John Anderson, who is running as an Independent, accepted the League of Women Voters\\' invitation to be here. President Carter declined. Mr. Reagan and Mr. Anderson will respond with their views on certain issues posed by questions from my colleagues: Carol Loomis of Fortune Magazine; Daniel Greenberg, a syndicated columnist; Charles Corddry of the Baltimore Sun; Lee May of The Los Angeles Times; James Bryant Quinn. Jane Bryant Quinn of Newsweek; and Soma Golden of The New York Times. None of the questions has been submitted in advance to either the League of Women Voters, or to the candidates, or to their representatives.\\n\\nGentlemen, thank you both for coming. The ground rules you agreed upon with the League are brief. Each panelist will ask a single question. You will have two and a half minutes in which to respond. After you\\'ve stated your positions in those two and a half minutes, each of you will have one minute and 15 seconds for response. At the close of the debate, each of you will have three minutes for closing remarks.\\n\\nWe ask the Convention Center audience to abide by one simple ground rule: Please do not applaud or express approval or disapproval during the debate. You may do that on November 4.\\n\\nHaving won the toss of the coin, Mr. Anderson will respond to the first question from Carol Loomis.\\n\\nCAROL LOOMIS, BOARD OF EDITORS,FORTUNE MAGAZINE : Mr. Anderson, opinion polls show that the American public sees inflation as the country\\'s number one economic problem, yet, as individuals, they oppose cures that hurt them personally. Elected officials have played along by promising to cure inflation while backing away from tough programs that might hurt one special interest group or another, and by actually adding inflationary elements to the system, such as indexing. They have gone for what is politically popular, rather than for what might work and amount to leadership.\\n\\nMy question, and please be specific, is what politically unpopular measures are you willing to endorse, push and stay with, that might provide real progress in reducing inflation?\\n\\nREP. JOHN B. ANDERSON: Miss Loomis, I think it\\'s very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign \\'80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years. Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I. The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend. But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me. Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter. I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible. That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation. Even though we\\'ve seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we\\'ve also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry. What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget. I think we\\'ve got to have fiscal restraint. And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees. That we ought to ... in addition to that, we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year, rather than twice a year, and save $750 billion. In other words....\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Anderson.\\n\\nANDERSON: fiscal restraint, I think is necessary.\\n\\nMOYERS: your time is up. Ms. Loomis?\\n\\nLOOMIS: Governor Reagan, repeating the question, and I would ask you, again, to engage in as many specifics as you possibly can. What politically unpopular measures are you willing to endorse, push and stay with that might provide real progress in reducing inflation?\\n\\nGOV. RONALD REAGAN: I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those. perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government. I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production. And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you\\'re causing inflation. And it isn\\'t really higher prices, it\\'s just, you are reducing the value of the money. You are robbing the American people of their savings. And so, the plan that I have proposed - and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology - all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations - produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings.\\n\\nNow, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn\\'t here tonight. But I don\\'t see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn\\'t inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on. I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections. conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget. We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we\\'re only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.\\n\\nMOYERS: Your time is up.\\n\\nREAGAN: ...and $500 billion over the next five.\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Anderson?\\n\\nANDERSON: Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline. I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that. those imports have been reduced. And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30. In other words, we\\'ve had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers. Whereas I have proposed we ought to take. put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil. Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments. their Social Security tax payments by 50%. That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country.\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Reagan.\\n\\nREAGAN: Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline. It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that. And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then we\\'re asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers. But why? Why take it in the first place if you\\'re going to give it back? Why not leave it with them? And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he. or 15 months ago, on what he believed in. Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.\\n\\nMOYERS: The next question goes to Mr. Reagan from Daniel Greenberg.\\n\\nGREENBERG, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, gentlemen, what I\\'d like to say first is, I think the panel and the audience would appreciate responsiveness to the questions, rather than repetitions of your campaign addresses. My question for the Governor is: Every serious examination of the future supply of energy and other essential resources - including air, land and water - finds that we face shortages and skyrocketing prices, and that, in many ways, we\\'re pushing the environment to dangerous limits. I\\'d like to know, specifically, what changes you would encourage and require in American lifestyles in automobile use, housing, land use and general consumption, to meet problems that aren\\'t going to respond to campaign lullabies about minor conservation efforts and more production?\\n\\nREAGAN: Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself. Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I\\'m for it. But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you\\'re doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply. To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact. The fact is, that in today\\'s oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used. But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground. And this is known oil reserves, known supplies. There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago. We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world\\'s coal supply, good for centuries, in this country. I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production. We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest. the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible. All of these things can be done. When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%. have leased only 2% of the possible. possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis. That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.\\n\\nMOYERS: I would like to say at this point that the candidates requested the same questions to be repeated, for the sake of precision, on the part of the interrogator. So, Mr. Greenberg, you may address Mr. Anderson.\\n\\nGREENBERG: Mr. Anderson, I\\'d like to know specifically, what changes you would encourage and require in American lifestyles in automobile use, housing, land use and consumption, to meet problems that aren\\'t going to respond to campaign lullabies about minor conservation efforts and more production?\\n\\nANDERSON: Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years\\' supply of natural gas, 47 years\\' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really. all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that\\'s going to be enough.\\n\\nI agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people. and that\\'s simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did. I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf. But at the same time, I think it\\'s going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile. We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities. We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling. We\\'re going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient. I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country. Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve. According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today. So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Reagan.\\n\\nREAGAN: Well, as I\\'ve said, I am not an enemy of conservation. I wouldn\\'t be called a conservative if I were. But, when my figures are challenged, as the President himself challenged them after I made them, I think it should be called to the attention of John and the others here that my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left. That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years. As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven\\'t been doing badly at that. Because in industry today, we\\'re producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973. And motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo. So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that. But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Anderson.\\n\\nANDERSON: Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact. And that is, that we cannot look at this as simply a national problem. Even though it\\'s true that, perhaps, between now and the end of the decade, our total consumption of oil may not increase by more than, perhaps, a million or 2 million barrels of oil a day. The rest of the Western world, we are told, may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million. And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity. It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies. I think that conservation - I think that a change in lifestyles - is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later.\\n\\nMOYERS: This question goes to you, Mr. Anderson, from Charles Corddry.\\n\\nCHARLES CORDDRY, MILITARY CORRESPONDENT,THE SUN , BALTIMORE: Mr. Anderson, you and Mr. Reagan both speak for better defense. for stronger defense and for programs that would mean spending more money. You do not, either of you, however, come to grips with the fundamental problem of manning the forces, of who shall serve, and how the burden will be distributed. This will surely be a critical issue in the next Presidential term. You both oppose the draft. The questions are, how would you fill the under-strength combat forces with numbers and quality, without reviving conscription? And will you commit yourself, here, tonight, should you become the Commander in Chief, to propose a draft, however unpopular, if it becomes clear that voluntary means are not working?\\n\\nANDERSON: Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country. When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test. And in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions. Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9. And there were reports. public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews. I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short. But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living. And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that\\'s a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time. And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today. And I think that\\'s shocking; it\\'s shameful. So, yes, I told the American Legion National! Convention, the VFW National Convention - when I spoke to each of those bodies - I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses. That only makes sense. But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Corddry?\\n\\nCORDDRY: Mr. Reagan, I will just repeat the two questions: How would you fill the under-strength combat forces with numbers and with quality, without reviving conscription? And will you commit yourself; here, tonight, should you become the Commander in Chief, to propose a draft, however unpopular, if it becomes clear that voluntary means are not solving our manpower problems?\\n\\nREAGAN: Mr. Corddry, it\\'s a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present. I. too, believe in the voluntary military. As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn\\'t have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees. I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work. Recognize that we have a voluntary military. We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and we\\'re asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment. And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and he\\'s earning less for himself and his family, while he\\'s away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home. As an aid to enlistment. we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I. Bill of Rights - the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education. In 1977, we took that away from the military. That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up. So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we\\'re going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven\\'s sakes, let\\'s go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we\\'re asking of them. Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate. We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant\\'s notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment. Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people. The other day, I just - I\\'ll hasten - I just saw one example. Down in Texas. I saw a high school that is military.\\n\\nMOYERS: Your time is up, Mr. Reagan.\\n\\nREAGAN: Fine.\\n\\nMOYERS: I\\'m sorry.\\n\\nREAGAN: I\\'ll catch up with it later.\\n\\nMOYERS: You can finish it after it\\'s over. Mr. Anderson?\\n\\nANDERSON: Mr. Moyers. I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money. We signed one bill. or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars. That is just a downpayment, in my opinion. But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile. I\\'ve just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion. The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion. I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle.\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Reagan?\\n\\nREAGAN: Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself. But that\\'s not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about. He\\'s talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states. And first, he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of SALT II treaty, and now he\\'s decided it\\'ll have a straight up and down thing, so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the Soviet Union. We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault. But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly. And therefore, if I only had another second left, I\\'d say that that high school class in a military training - 40 of its 80 graduates last year entered the United States service academies; West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and to see those young men made me very proud to realize that there are young people in this country that are prepared to go into that kind of a career in service of their country.\\n\\nMOYERS: This question comes to you, Mr. Reagan, from my colleague, Lee May.\\n\\nLEE MAY, STAFF WRITER,THE LOS ANGELES TIMES - WASHINGTON BUREAU: Mr. Reagan, the military is not the only area in crisis. American cities are physically wearing out, as housing, streets, sewers and budgets all fall apart. And all of this is piled upon the emotional strain that comes from refugees and racial confrontations. Now, I\\'m wondering what specific plans do you have for Federal involvement in saving our cities from these physical and emotional! crises, and how would you carry out those plans in addition to raising military pay, without going against your pledge of fiscal restraint?\\n\\nREAGAN: I don\\'t think I\\'d have to go against that pledge. I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid. The mayors that I\\'ve talked to in some of our leading cities tell! me that the Federal grants that come with. for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government\\'s hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority. If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money. What I have been advocating is, why don\\'t we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs? Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities. I don\\'t know of a city in America that doesn\\'t have the kind of problems you\\'re talking about. But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them? New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit. But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let\\'s say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia. Wouldn\\'t it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place? But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I\\'ve believed. I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives. The government isn\\'t getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren\\'t there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working. And why don\\'t we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones? Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there. The individuals that would then get jobs - give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work. We could have an urban homestead act. We\\'ve got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures. What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house. All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it - just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country - urban . or country homesteading.\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. May?\\n\\nMAY: Mr. Anderson, let me ask you, what specific plans do you have for Federal involvement in saving cities from the physical and emotional crises that confront them, and how would you carry out those plans, in addition to raising military pay, without going against your pledge of fiscal restraint?\\n\\nANDERSON: Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960. It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America. Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits. I\\'m happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America. We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question - to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains. I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn\\'t money available to fix them. And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs. We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we\\'ve told you where the money is coming from. It\\'s going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco. That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities. In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Reagan, your response.\\n\\nREAGAN: Yes. Government claims. John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from. It will come from the pockets of the people. It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas. And the problem is, with Governments - Federal, State and Local - taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities. if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, it\\'s because the Federal Government has pre-empted. Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it. But the Federal Government doesn\\'t make money. It just takes - from the people. And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem. Stand in the South Bronx as I did, in the spot where Jimmy Carter made his promise that he was going to, with multi-billion dollar programs, refurbish that area that looks like bombed-out London in World War II. I stood there, and I met the people. And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope. And I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, they\\'ve never been carried out. But I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that, if we would move into those areas and let, encourage - with the tax incentive - the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people.\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Anderson.\\n\\nANDERSON: Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating? It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country. We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth. And why is that? It\\'s because they have lost their industry. And why have they lost their industry? It\\'s because they no longer present the kind of viable economic climate that makes it possible for industry to remain there, or to locate there. I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.\\n\\nMOYERS: Jane Bryant Quinn has the next question, for you, Mr. Anderson.\\n\\nJANE BRYANT QUINN, CBS NEWS/NEWSWEEK /WASHINGTON POST : Mr. Anderson, many voters are very worried that tax cuts, nice as they are, will actually add to inflation. And many eminent conservatives have testified that even business tax cuts, as you have proposed, can be inflationary as long as we have a budget deficit. Now, Mr. Reagan has mentioned that he put out a five-year economic forecast, which indeed he did, but it contained no inflation number. You have published a detailed program, but it too does not have any hard numbers on it about how these things work with inflation. So I would like to ask you, if you will commit to publish specific forecasts within two weeks, so that the voters can absorb them and understand them and analyze them, showing exactly what al these problems you\\'ve mentioned tonight - on energy, on defense, on the cities - how these impact on inflation, and what inflation\\'s actually going to be over five years.\\n\\nANDERSON: Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it\\'s going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver. When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver. Well, we\\'ve seen what has happened. We haven\\'t gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven\\'t gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter\\'s first term. Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%. And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that\\'s about 18% on an annualized basis - what it\\'s going to be. Let me say this. I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan. His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information. He went so far as to call it \"brutal economics.\" I\\'ve been very careful - I have been very careful in saying that what I\\'m going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first. I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done. But, you know, it\\'s gotten to be about $122 difference. Somebody worked it out. And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more. So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes. And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income. I\\'m going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I\\'ve talked about. But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.\\n\\nMOYERS: Ms. Quinn.\\n\\nQUINN: Mr. Anderson, I\\'ll call you for that forecast. Mr. Reagan, will you publish specific forecasts within two weeks, so that the voters can have time to analyze and absorb them before the election, showing exactly what all these things you\\'ve discussed tonight - for energy, cities and defense - mean for inflation over the next five years?\\n\\nREAGAN: Miss Quinn, I don\\'t have to. I\\'ve done it. We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures. And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee\\'s projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated. And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how. how well it could be done. Now, John\\'s been in the Congress for 20 years. And John tells us that first, we\\'ve got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes. Well, if you\\'ve got a kid that\\'s extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance. Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker. But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs. Government always needs the money it gets. And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs. Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world. And that state we controlled spending. We cut the rate of increase in spending in half. But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion. I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned. And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending. And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment. We have considered inflation in our figures. We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative. I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that\\'s what he\\'s counting on for his plan. But he\\'s going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget. We believe that that\\'s too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Anderson.\\n\\nANDERSON: Mr. Moyers, I\\'m not here to debate Governor Reagan\\'s record as Governor. This is 1980 and not 1966. But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office. Spending, in other words. more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government. But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans. It doesn\\'t accommodate the expenditures that he calls for, for accelerated development and deployment of a new manned strategic bomber, for a permanent fleet in the Indian Ocean, for the restoration of the fleet to 600 ships, to the development and deployment of a dedicated modern aircraft interceptor. In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military. And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.\\n\\nMOYERS: Would would you have a comment, Mr. Reagan?\\n\\nREAGAN: Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures. And John has just made up some very interesting figures. We took the Senate report, of course. But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary. Now also, with regard to the figures about California. The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half. It at the John doesn\\'t quite realize - he\\'s never held an executive position of that kind. And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that\\'s possible, of any executive job in America today - because it is the most populous state. And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years. And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.\\n\\nMOYERS: Our final question comes from Soma Golden, and it\\'s directed to Mr. Reagan.\\n\\nGOLDEN, EDITORIAL WRITER,THE NEW YORK TIMES : I\\'d like to switch the focus from inflation to God. This week, Cardinal Medeiros of Boston warned Catholics that it\\'s sinful to vote for candidates who favor abortion. This did not defeat the two men he opposed, but it did raise questions about the roles of church and state. You. Mr. Reagan, have endorsed the participation of fundamentalist churches in your campaign. And you, Mr. Anderson, have tried three times to amend the Constitution to recognize the, quote, \"law and authority,\" unquote, of Jesus Christ. My question: Do you approve of the Church\\'s actions this week in Boston? And should a President be guided by organized religion on issues like abortion, equal rights, and defense spending?\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Reagan.\\n\\nGOLDEN: Mr. Reagan.\\n\\nREAGAN: Oh, I\\'m it\\'s my question. But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don\\'t think there\\'s any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we\\'ve abandoned so much in this country. Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival. For a belief that law must be based on a higher law. For a return to traditions and values that we once had. Our Government, in its most sacred documents - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all - speak of man being created, of a Creator. That we\\'re a nation under God. Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Government\\'s invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child. I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California. Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I won\\'t take a position on that. But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader. That\\'s what elections are all about.\\n\\nMOYERS: Ms. Golden.\\n\\nGOLDEN: Okay. I would point out that churches are tax-exempt institutions, and I\\'ll repeat my question. Do you approve the Church\\'s action this week in Boston, and should a President be guided by organized religion on issues like abortion, equal rights and defense spending?\\n\\nANDERSON: Ms. Golden, certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues. But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned - that specific case - to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state. Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion. I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual. And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of. And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, \"view,\" on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government. No. I believe in freedom of choice. I don\\'t believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that. I don\\'t believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary. On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago. And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - it\\'s a very deeply personal matter. But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong. And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools. I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, \"Be sure to say a prayer before you start your day\\'s work.\" But I don\\'t think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Reagan.\\n\\nREAGAN: The litmus test that John says is in the Republican platform, says no more than the judges to be appointed should have a respect for innocent life. Now, I don\\'t think that\\'s a bad idea. I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life. With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there\\'s one individual who\\'s not being considered at all. That\\'s the one who is being aborted. And I\\'ve noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born. I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being? I happen to believe it is.\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Anderson.\\n\\nANDERSON: I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted. And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term. And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual\\'s conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual.\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Reagan you now have three minutes for closing remarks.\\n\\nREAGAN: Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening. And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond. But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate. And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement. Now, as to my closing remarks: I\\'ve always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan. That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people - people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible. We came from 100 different corners of the earth. We spoke a multitude of tongues. We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches. If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again. And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American - a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part. Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again. Today. we\\'re confronted with the horrendous problems that we\\'ve discussed here tonight. And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat. That the best is over. That we must cut back. That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity. That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary. Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars. We\\'ve gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees. But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness. The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth. For 200 years, we\\'ve lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday. I still believe that. I\\'m not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we\\'ve discussed tonight. I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again. We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill. I think we ought to get at it.\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Anderson, you have the final three minutes.\\n\\nANDERSON: Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties. I think you\\'ve seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing - we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft. We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue. I respect him for showing tonight - for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me. I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble. I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems. If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy? Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable? Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be? Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote? I don\\'t think you do think that. And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980. You know, a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing. It\\'s been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes. We\\'ve got to stop drifting. What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important. A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November. And he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding. If we don\\'t resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant. The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be? The issue of nationalism - the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere - that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states\\' rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis. Those are some of the great issues - atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism - that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems. Thank you.\\n\\nMOYERS: Mr. Anderson, we, too, wish there were more time, and for all the limitations of the form - and there are other forms to try - the Chair, for one, would like to see such meetings become a regular and frequent part of every Presidential campaign. Mr. Reagan, Mr. Anderson, we thank you for coming, and thanks to our panelists, Carol Loomis, Daniel Greenberg, Charles Corddry, Lee May, Jane Bryant Quinn and Soma Golden. And thank you in the audience at home for joining us. This first Presidential Debate of 1980 has been brought to you as a public service by the League of Women Voters Education Fund. I\\'m Bill Moyers. Good night.'}, {'file': '92_debate_1', 'content': 'Carole Simpson. Good evening, and welcome to the second of three Presidential debates between the major candidates for President of the United States. The candidates are the Republican nominee, President George Bush; the independent, Ross Perot; and Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee.\\n\\nMy name is Carole Simpson, and I will be the moderator for tonight\\'s 90-minute debate which is coming to you from the campus of the University of Richmond in Richmond, Virginia.\\n\\nNow, tonight\\'s program is unlike any other Presidential debate in history. We\\'re making history now, and it\\'s pretty exciting. An independent polling firm has selected an audience of 209 uncommitted voters from this area. The candidates will be asked questions by these voters on a topic of their choosing, anything they want to ask about. My job as moderator is to, you know, take care of the questioning, ask questions myself if I think there needs to be continuity and balance, and sometimes I might ask the candidates to respond to what another candidate may have said.\\n\\nNow, the format has been agreed to by representatives of both the Republican and Democratic campaigns, and there is no subject matter that is restricted. Anything goes. We can ask anything. After the debate the candidates will have an opportunity to make a closing statement.\\n\\nSo, President Bush, I think you said it earlier, let\\'s get it on.\\n\\nPresident Bush. Let\\'s go.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. And I think the first question is over here.\\n\\nForeign Trade and Domestic Jobs\\n\\nQ. I\\'d like to direct my question to Mr. Perot. What will you do as President to open foreign markets to fair competition from American business and to stop unfair competition here at home from foreign countries so that we can bring jobs back to the United States?\\n\\nMr. Perot. That\\'s right at the top of my agenda. We\\'ve shipped millions of jobs overseas, and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after you\\'ve served for a while, you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on Presidential campaigns, make sure you got good contacts, and then go back out.\\n\\nNow, if you just want to get down to brass tacks, first thing you ought to do is get all these folks that have got these one-way trade agreements that we\\'ve negotiated over the years and say, \"Fellas, we\\'ll take the same deal we gave you.\" They\\'ll gridlock right at that point, because, for example, we\\'ve got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships if they had to comply, you see, if it was a two-way street, just couldn\\'t do it.\\n\\nWe have got to stop sending jobs overseas. To those of you in the audience who are business people, pretty simple: If you\\'re paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay $1 an hour for labor, hire young -- let\\'s assume you\\'ve been in business for a long time; you\\'ve got a mature work force -- pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care -- that\\'s the most expensive single element in making a car -- have no environmental controls, no pollution controls, and no retirement, and you don\\'t care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south. So if the people send me to Washington, the first thing I\\'ll do is study that 2,000-page agreement and make sure it\\'s a two-way street.\\n\\nI have one last part here. I decided I was dumb and didn\\'t understand it, so I called the \"Who\\'s Who\" of the folks that have been around it. And I said, \"Why won\\'t everybody go south?\" They say, \"It would be disruptive.\" I said, \"For how long?\" I finally got them up for 12 to 15 years. And I said, \"Well, how does it stop being disruptive?\" And that is, when their jobs come up from $1 an hour to $6 an hour, and ours go down to $6 an hour, then it\\'s leveled again. But in the meantime, you\\'ve wrecked the country with these kinds of deals. We\\'ve got to cut it out.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you, Mr. Perot. I see that the President has stood up, so he must have something to say about this.\\n\\nPresident Bush. Well, Carole, the thing that saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our exports, and what I\\'m trying to do is increase our exports. If, indeed, all the jobs were going to move south because of lower wages, there are lower wages now, and they haven\\'t done that. So I have just negotiated with the President of Mexico the North American free trade agreement, and the Prime Minister of Canada, I might add. I want to have more of these free trade agreements because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas. That\\'s a scare tactic, because it\\'s not that many. But any one that\\'s here, we want to have more jobs here, and the way to do that is to increase our exports.\\n\\nSome believe in protection. I don\\'t. I believe in free and fair trade. That\\'s the thing that saved us. And so I will keep on, as President, trying to get a successful conclusion to the GATT round, the big Uruguay round of trade which will really open up markets for our agriculture, particularly. I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year. I want to get one with Eastern Europe. I want to get one with Chile. Free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.\\n\\nAs I say, we\\'ve had tough economic times, and it\\'s exports that have saved us, exports that have built -- --\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Governor Clinton.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. I\\'d like to answer the question, because I\\'ve actually been a Governor for 12 years, so I\\'ve known a lot of people who have lost their jobs because of jobs moving overseas, and I know a lot of people whose plants have been strengthened by increasing exports.\\n\\nThe trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us. It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up, and our trade deficit\\'s gone down. It\\'s also true that just today a record-high trade deficit was announced with Japan.\\n\\nSo what is the answer? Let me just mention three things very quickly. Number one, make sure that other countries are as open to our markets as our markets are to them. If they\\'re not, have measures on the books that don\\'t take forever and a day to implement.\\n\\nNumber two, change the Tax Code. There are more deductions in the Tax Code for shutting plants down and moving overseas than there are for modernizing plants and equipment here. Our competitors don\\'t do that. Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plants and equipment here, not moving plants overseas.\\n\\nNumber three, stop the Federal Government\\'s program that now gives low interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries, but we won\\'t do the same thing for plants that stay here. So more trade, but on fair terms, and favor investment in America.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you. I think we have a question over here.\\n\\nFederal Deficit\\n\\nQ. This is for Governor Clinton. In the real world, that is, outside of Washington, DC, compensation and achievement are based on goals defined and achieved. My question is about the deficit. Would you define in specific dollar goals how much you would reduce the deficit in each of the 4 years of a Clinton administration and then enter into a legally binding contract with the American people that if you did not achieve those goals that you would not seek a second term? Answer yes or no, and then comment on your answer, please.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. No, and here\\'s why; I\\'ll tell you exactly why, because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years. I\\'ll tell you exactly what I think can be done. I think we can bring it down by 50 percent in 4 years and grow the economy.\\n\\nNow, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you\\'d have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them, and it would even make the economy worse.\\n\\nMr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years, but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years. So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy, and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs, and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes, and investing in growing this economy.\\n\\nI ask everybody to look at my economic ideas. Nine Nobel Prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans, said this is the way you\\'ve got to go. If you don\\'t grow the economy, you can\\'t get it done. But I can\\'t foresee all the things that will happen, and I don\\'t think a President should be judged solely on the deficit.\\n\\nLet me also say we\\'re having an election today. You\\'ll have a shot at me in 4 years, and you can vote me right out if you think I\\'ve done a lousy job. I would welcome you to do that.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Mr. President?\\n\\nPresident Bush. Well, I\\'ve got to -- I\\'m a little confused here because I don\\'t see how you can grow the deficit down by raising people\\'s taxes. You see, I don\\'t think the American people are taxed too little. I think they\\'re taxed too much. I went for one tax increase, and when I make a mistake, I admit it, say that wasn\\'t the right thing to do. Governor Clinton\\'s program wants to tax more and spend more: $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220 billion. I don\\'t believe that\\'s the way to do it.\\n\\nHere\\'s some things that will help. Give us a balanced budget amendment. He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget, and they do. But he has a balanced budget amendment; have to do it. I\\'d like the Government to have that. I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch.\\n\\nI\\'d like to have what 43 Governors have, the line-item veto. So if the Congress can\\'t cut, we\\'ve got a reckless spending Congress, let the President have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature.\\n\\nI\\'ve proposed another one. Some sophisticates think it may be a little gimmicky. I think it\\'s good. It\\'s a check-off. It says to you as a taxpayer -- say, you\\'re going to pay a tax of $1,000 or something; you can check 10 percent of that if you want to in one box, and that 10 percent, $100, or if you\\'re paying $10,000, whatever it is, $1,000, check it off, and make the Government, make it lower the deficit by that amount. If the Congress won\\'t do it, if they can\\'t get together and negotiate how to do that, then you\\'d have a sequester across the board. You\\'d exempt Social Security. I don\\'t want to tax or touch Social Security. I\\'m the President that said, \"Hey, don\\'t mess with Social Security.\" And we haven\\'t.\\n\\nSo I believe we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman\\'s question, that\\'s the main growing thing in the budget. The program that the President -- two-thirds of the budget, I, as President, never get to look at, never get to touch. We\\'ve got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now. I just don\\'t believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. How about you, Mr. Perot?\\n\\nMr. Perot. Well, we\\'re $4 trillion in debt, and we\\'re going into debt an additional $1 billion, a little more than $1 billion, every working day of the year. Now, the thing I love about it -- I\\'m just a businessman. I was down in Texas, taking care of business, tending to my family. This situation got so bad that I decided I had better get into it. The American people asked me to get into it. But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight, we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.\\n\\nNow, it\\'s not the Republicans\\' fault, of course, and it\\'s not the Democrats\\' fault. What I\\'m looking for is who did it? Now, they\\'re the two folks involved; so maybe if you put them together, they did it. Now, the facts are we have to fix it.\\n\\nI\\'m here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college. When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy, I had multiple job offers. Young people with high grades can\\'t get a job. The 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now. In other words, we were down to -- 18 percent of them were making -- the 18- to 24-year-olds were making less than $12,000. Now that\\'s up to 40 percent. And what\\'s happening in the meantime? The dollar\\'s gone through the floor.\\n\\nNow, whose fault is that? Not the Democrats; not the Republicans. Somewhere out there there\\'s an extraterrestrial that\\'s doing this to us, I guess. [Laughter] And everybody says they take responsibility. Somebody, somewhere has to take responsibility for this. Put it to you bluntly, the American people: If you want me to be your President, we\\'re going to face our problems. We\\'ll deal with the problems. We\\'ll solve our problems. We\\'ll pay down our debt. We\\'ll pass on the American dream to our children. I will not leave our children a situation that they have today.\\n\\nWhen I was a boy, it took two generations to double the standard of living. Today it will take 12 generations. Our children will not see the American dream because of this debt that somebody, somewhere dropped on us.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. You\\'re all wonderful speakers, and I know you have lots more to add. But I have talked to this audience, and they have lots of questions on other topics. Can we move to another topic, please?\\n\\nWe have one up here, I think.\\n\\nPresidential Campaign\\n\\nQ. Yes, I\\'d like to address all the candidates with this question. The amount of time the candidates have spent in this campaign trashing their opponents\\' character and their programs is depressingly large. Why can\\'t your discussions and proposals reflect the genuine complexity and the difficulty of the issues to try to build a consensus around the best aspects of all proposals?\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Who wants to take that one? Mr. Perot, you have an answer for everything, don\\'t you? Go right ahead, sir. [Laughter]\\n\\nMr. Perot. No, I don\\'t have an answer for everything. As you all know, I\\'ve been buying 30-minute segments to talk about issues. Tomorrow night on NBC from 10:30 to 11, eastern, we\\'re going to talk about how you pay the debt down. So we\\'re going to come right down to that one, see. We\\'ll be on again Saturday night 8 to 9 o\\'clock on ABC. [Laughter]\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Okay, okay.\\n\\nMr. Perot. So the point is, finally, I couldn\\'t agree with you more, couldn\\'t agree with you more. And I have said again and again and again, let\\'s get off mud wrestling. Let\\'s get off personalities, and let\\'s talk about jobs, health care, crime, the things that concern the American people. I\\'m spending my money, not PAC money, not foreign money, my money to take this message to the people.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you, Mr. Perot. So that seems directed. He would say it\\'s you gentlemen that have been doing that. Mr. Clinton, Governor Clinton, how do you -- President Bush, how would you like to respond?\\n\\nPresident Bush. Well, first place, I believe that character is a part of being President. I think you have to look at it. I think that has to be a part of candidate for President or being President. In terms of programs, I\\'ve submitted, what, four different budgets to the United States Congress in great detail. They\\'re so heavy they\\'d give you a broken back. Everything in there says what I am for. Now, I\\'ve come out with a new agenda for America\\'s renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy.\\n\\nMy record on world affairs is pretty well-known because I\\'ve been President for 4 years. So I feel I\\'ve been talking issues. Nobody likes \"who shot John,\" but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton. And I\\'m not going to sit there and be a punching bag. I\\'m going to stand up and say, \"Hey, listen, here\\'s my side of it.\" But character is an important part of the equation.\\n\\nThe other night, Governor Clinton raised -- I don\\'t know if you saw the debate the other night, suffered through that. [Laughter] Well, he raised a question of my father. It was a good line, well-rehearsed and well-delivered. But he raised a question of my father and said, \"Well, your father, Prescott Bush, was against McCarthy. You should be ashamed of yourself -- McCarthyism.\"\\n\\nI remember something my dad told me. I was 18 years old, going to Penn Station to go into the Navy. He said, \"Write your mother,\" which I faithfully did. He said, \"Serve your country.\" My father was an honor, duty, and country man. And he said, \"Tell the truth.\" And I\\'ve tried to do that in public life, all through it. That has said something about character.\\n\\nMy argument with Governor Clinton -- you can call it mud wrestling, but I think it\\'s fair to put it in focus -- is I am deeply troubled by someone who demonstrates and organizes demonstration in a foreign land when his country\\'s at war. Probably a lot of kids here disagree with me, but that\\'s what I feel. That\\'s what I feel passionately about. I\\'m thinking of Ross Perot\\'s running mate sitting in the jail; how would he feel about it? But maybe that\\'s generational. I don\\'t know.\\n\\nBut the big argument I have with the Governor on this is this taking different positions on different issues, trying to be one thing to one person here that\\'s opposing the NAFTA agreement and then for it; what we call waffling. And I do think that you can\\'t turn the White House into the waffle house. You\\'ve got to say what you\\'re for. And you have got to -- --\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Mr. President, I am getting time cues, and with all due respect, I\\'m sorry.\\n\\nPresident Bush. Excuse me, I don\\'t want to -- no, go ahead, Carole.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Governor Clinton.\\n\\nPresident Bush. I get wound up because I feel strongly.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Yes, you do. [Laughter]\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. Let me say first of all to you that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight. I started doing these formats a year ago in New Hampshire, and I found that we had huge crowds because all I did was let people ask questions, and I tried to give very specific answers. I also had a program starting last year.\\n\\nI\\'ve been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign. Thank goodness the networks have a fact check so I don\\'t have to just go blue in the face anymore. Mr. Bush said once again tonight I was going to have a $150 billion tax increase. When Mr. Quayle said that, all the networks said: that\\'s not true; he\\'s got over $100 billion in tax cuts and incentives.\\n\\nSo I\\'m not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this. We\\'ll have a debate in 4 days, and we can talk about this character thing again, but the Washington Post ran a long editorial today saying they couldn\\'t believe Mr. Bush was making character an issue, and they said he was the greatest political chameleon, for changing his positions, of all time.\\n\\nNow, I don\\'t want to get into that -- --\\n\\nPresident Bush. Please don\\'t say anything by the Washington Post.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. Wait a minute. Let\\'s don\\'t -- you don\\'t have to believe that. Here\\'s my point. I\\'m not interested in his character. I want to change the character of the Presidency. And I\\'m interested in what we can trust him to do and what you can trust me to do and what you can trust Mr. Perot to do for the next 4 years. So I think you\\'re right, and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. May I -- I talked to this audience before you gentlemen came, and I asked them about how they felt about the tenor of the campaign. Would you like to let them know what you thought about that, when I said, \"Are you pleased with how the campaign\\'s been going?\"\\n\\nAudience members. No!\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Who wants to say why you don\\'t like the way the campaign is going? We have a gentleman back here?\\n\\nFocusing on Issues\\n\\nQ. If I may, and forgive the notes here, but I\\'m shy on camera. The focus of my work as a domestic mediator is meeting the needs of the children that I work with by way of their parents, and not the wants of their parents. I ask the three of you, how can we as, symbolically, the children of the future President, expect the two of you, the three of you, to meet our needs, the needs in housing and in crime and you name it, as opposed to the wants of your political spin doctors and your political parties?\\n\\nMs. Simpson. So your question is -- --\\n\\nQ. Can we focus on the issues and not the personalities and the mud? I think there is a need -- if we could take a poll here with the folks from Gallup, perhaps -- I think there is a real need here to focus at this point on the needs.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. How do you respond? How do you gentlemen respond to -- --\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. I agree with him.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. President Bush?\\n\\nPresident Bush. Let\\'s do it. Let\\'s talk about programs for children.\\n\\nQ. Could we cross our hearts, and it sounds silly here, but could we make a commitment? You know, we\\'re not under oath at this point, but could you make a commitment to the citizens of the United States to meet our needs, and we have many, and not yours again? You know, I repeat that; that\\'s a real need I think that we all have.\\n\\nPresident Bush. I think it depends on how you define it. I mean, I think, in general, let\\'s talk about these issues, let\\'s talk about the programs. But in the Presidency, a lot goes into it. Caring goes into it; that\\'s not particularly specific. Strength goes into it; that\\'s not specific. Standing up against aggression; that\\'s not specific in terms of a program. This is what a President has to do.\\n\\nSo, in principle, though, I\\'ll take your point. I think we ought to discuss child care or whatever else it is.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. And you two?\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. Ross had his hand up.\\n\\nMr. Perot. No hedges, no ifs, ands, and buts, I\\'ll take the pledge, because I know the American people want to talk about issues and not tabloid journalism. So I\\'ll take the pledge, and we\\'ll stay on the issues.\\n\\nNow, just for the record, I don\\'t have any spin doctors. I don\\'t have any speechwriters. Probably shows. [Laughter] I make those charts you see on television even. [Laughter] But you don\\'t have to wonder if it\\'s me talking. Hey, what you see is what you get. If you don\\'t like it, you\\'ve got two other choices, right?\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. Wait a minute. I want to say just one thing now, Ross, in fairness. The ideas I express are mine. I\\'ve worked on these things for 12 years, and I\\'m the only person up here who hasn\\'t been part of Washington in any way for the last 20 years. So I don\\'t want the implication to be that somehow everything we say is just cooked up and put in our head by somebody else. I worked 12 years very hard as a Governor on the real problems of real people. I\\'m just as sick as you are by having to wake up and figure out how to defend myself every day. I never thought I\\'d ever be involved in anything like this.\\n\\nMr. Perot. May I finish?\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Yes, you may finish.\\n\\nMr. Perot. Very briefly?\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Yes, very briefly.\\n\\nMr. Perot. I don\\'t have any foreign money in my campaign. I don\\'t have any foreign lobbyists on leave in my campaign. I don\\'t have any PAC money in my campaign. I\\'ve got 5 1/2 million hard-working people who have put me on the ballot, and I belong to them.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Okay.\\n\\nMr. Perot. And they are interested in what you\\'re interested in. I\\'ll take the pledge. I\\'ve already taken the pledge on cutting the deficit in half. I never got to say that. There\\'s a great young group, Lead or Leave, college students, young people who don\\'t want us to spend their money. I took the pledge we\\'d cut it out.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you. We have a question here.\\n\\nDomestic Infrastructure\\n\\nQ. Yes. I would like to get a response from all three gentlemen. And the question is, what are your plans to improve the physical infrastructure of this Nation, which includes the water system, the sewer system, our transportation systems, et cetera? Thank you.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. The cities. Who is going to fix the cities, and how?\\n\\nPresident Bush. I\\'d be glad to take a shot at it.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Please.\\n\\nPresident Bush. I\\'m not sure that -- and I can understand if you haven\\'t seen this because there\\'s been a lot of hue and cry. We passed this year the most farthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways, $150 billion for improving the infrastructure. That happened when I was President. So I am very proud of the way that came about, and I think it\\'s a very, very good beginning.\\n\\nLike Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits. And $150 billion is a lot of money, but it\\'s awful hard to say we\\'re going to go out and spend more money when we\\'re trying to get the deficit down. But I would cite that as a major accomplishment.\\n\\nWe hear all the negatives. When you\\'re President, you expect this. Everybody\\'s running against the incumbent. They can do better; everyone knows that. But here\\'s something that we can take great pride in because it really does get to what you\\'re talking about. Our home initiative, our homeownership initiative, HOPE, that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements.\\n\\nOur enterprise zones that we hear a lot of lip service about in Congress would bring jobs into the inner city. There\\'s a good program. I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in substantial way by the Congress.\\n\\nWhen we went out to South Central in Los Angeles -- some of you may remember the riots there. I went out there. I went to a boys club, and every one of them, the boys club leaders, the ministers, all of them were saying, pass enterprise zones. We go back to Washington, and very difficult to get it through the Congress.\\n\\nBut there\\'s going to be a new Congress. No one likes gridlock. There\\'s going to be a new Congress because the old one, I don\\'t want to get this man mad at me, but there was a post office scandal and a bank scandal. You\\'re going to have a lot of new Members of Congress. And then you can sit down and say, \"Help me do what we should for the cities. Help me pass these programs.\"\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Mr. President, aren\\'t you threatening to veto the bill, the urban aid bill, that included enterprise zones?\\n\\nPresident Bush. Sure, but the problem is you get so many things included in a great big bill that you have to look at the overall good. That\\'s the problem with our system. If you had a line-item veto, you could knock out the pork. You could knock out the tax increases, and you could do what the people want, and that is create enterprise zones.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Governor Clinton, you\\'re chomping at the bit.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. That bill pays for these urban enterprise zones by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more, and that\\'s why he wants to veto it, just like he vetoed an earlier bill this year. This is not mud slinging. This is fact slinging.\\n\\nPresident Bush. There you go.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. A bill earlier this year -- this is fact -- that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities and our country. But it asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more. Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing. I agree with him. I mean, we agree with that.\\n\\nLet me tell you specifically what my plan does: My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation, communications, environmental cleanup, and new technologies for the 21st century. We would target it especially in areas that have been either depressed or which have lost a lot of defense-related jobs.\\n\\nThere are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense-related jobs. They ought to be engaged in making high-speed rail. They ought to be engaged in breaking ground in other technologies, doing waste recycling, clean water technology, and things of that kind. We can create millions of jobs in these new technologies, more than we\\'re going to lose in defense if we target it. But we\\'re investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors. Our wealth growth is going down as a result of it. It\\'s making the country poorer, which is why I answered the gentleman the way I did before.\\n\\nWe have to both bring down the deficit and get our economy going through these kinds of investments in order to get the kind of wealth and jobs and incomes we need in America.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Mr. Perot, what about your plans for the cities? You want to tackle the economy and the deficit first.\\n\\nMr. Perot. First, you\\'ve got to have money to pay for these things. So you\\'ve got to create jobs, and there are all kinds of ways to create jobs in the inner city. Now, I am not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed, because I talked to the Democratic leaders, and they want it. I talked to the Republican leaders, and they want it. But since they are bred from childhood to fight with one another rather than get results, I would be glad to drop out and spend a little time and see if we couldn\\'t build some bridges.\\n\\nNow, results is what counts. The President can\\'t order Congress around. Congress can\\'t order the President around. That\\'s not bad for a guy that\\'s never been there, right? But you have to work together. Now, I have talked to the chairmen of the committees that want this; they\\'re Democrats. The President wants it. But we can\\'t get it because we sit here in gridlock because it\\'s a campaign year. We didn\\'t fund a lot of other things this year, like the savings and loan mess. That\\'s another story that we\\'re going to pay a big price for right after the election.\\n\\nThe facts are, though, the facts are the American people are hurting. These people are hurting in the inner cities. We\\'re shipping the low-paying, quote, \"low-paying\" jobs overseas. What are low-paying jobs? Textiles, shoes, things like that that we say are yesterday\\'s industries. They\\'re tomorrow\\'s industries in the inner city.\\n\\nLet me say in my case, if I\\'m out of work, I\\'ll cut grass tomorrow to take care of my family. I\\'ll be happy to make shoes. I\\'ll be happy to make clothing. I\\'ll make sausage. You just give me a job. Put those jobs in the inner cities, instead of doing diplomatic deals and shipping them to China, where prison labor does the work.\\n\\nWashington Gridlock\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Mr. Perot, everybody thought you won the first debate because you were plain-speaking, and you make it sound, oh, so simple. \"We\\'ll just do it.\" What makes you think that you\\'re going to be able to get the Democrats and Republicans together any better than these guys?\\n\\nMr. Perot. If you asked me if I could fly a fighter plane or be an astronaut, I can\\'t. I\\'ve spent my life creating jobs. It\\'s something I know how to do, and very simply in the inner city, they\\'re starved. You see, small businesses is the way to jump-start the inner city.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Are you answering my question? [Laughter]\\n\\nMr. Perot. You want jobs in the inner city? Do you want jobs in the inner city? Is that your question?\\n\\nMs. Simpson. No, I want you to tell me how you\\'re going to be able to get the Republicans and Democrats in Congress -- --\\n\\nMr. Perot. Oh, I\\'m sorry.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. -- -- to work together better than these two gentlemen.\\n\\nMr. Perot. I\\'ve listened to both sides. If they would talk to one another instead of throwing rocks, I think we could get a lot done. And among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee, to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, to the President who\\'s anxious, I\\'d say, \"Rather than just yelling at one another, why don\\'t we find out where we\\'re apart; try to get together. Get the bill passed, and give the people the benefits, and not play party politics right now.\"\\n\\nI think the press would follow that so closely that probably they would get it done. That\\'s the way I would do it. I doubt if they\\'ll give me the chance, but I will drop everything and go work on it.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Okay. I have a question here.\\n\\nGun Control and Crime\\n\\nQ. My question was originally for Governor Clinton, but I think I would welcome a response from all three candidates. As you are aware, crime is rampant in our cities. In the Richmond area, and I\\'m sure it\\'s happened elsewhere, 12-year-olds are carrying guns to school. And I\\'m sure when our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, they did not mean for the right to bear arms to apply to 12-year-olds. So I\\'m asking, where do you stand on gun control, and what do you plan to do about it?\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Governor Clinton?\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. I support the right to keep and bear arms. I live in a State where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses or both. But I believe we have to have some way of checking handguns before they\\'re sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them. Therefore, I support the Brady bill, which would impose a national waiting period, unless and until a State did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records. Once you automate your records, then you don\\'t have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.\\n\\nI also think we should have, frankly, restrictions on assault weapons, whose only purpose is to kill. We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up.\\n\\nThe third thing I would say doesn\\'t bear directly on gun control, but it\\'s very important. We need more police on the street. There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly by Republican Senators. I think it\\'s a shame it didn\\'t pass. I think it should be made the law, but it had the Brady bill in it, the waiting period.\\n\\nI also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers. I think as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers.\\n\\nThirty years ago there were three police officers on the street for every crime. Today, there are three crimes for every police officer. In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, or on the same blocks, you\\'ve seen crime go down. In Houston there\\'s been a 15-percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the Mayor did there in increasing the police force. So I know it can work. I\\'ve seen it happen.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you.\\n\\nPresident Bush?\\n\\nPresident Bush. I think you put your finger on a major problem. I talk about strengthening the American family. It\\'s very hard to strengthen the family if people are scared to walk down to the corner store and send their kid down to get a loaf of bread. It\\'s very hard. I have been fighting for very strong anticrime legislation: habeas corpus reform, so you don\\'t have these endless appeals; so when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real. I\\'ve been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule, so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn\\'t go away. I\\'ll probably get into a fight in this room with some, but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers.\\n\\nVirginia\\'s in lead in this, as Governor Clinton properly said, on this identification system for firearms. I am not for national registration of firearms. Some of the States that have the toughest antigun laws have the highest levels of crime. I am for the right -- as the Governor says, I\\'m a sportsman, and I don\\'t think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons.\\n\\nBut I was not for the bill that he was talking about because it was not tough enough on the criminal. I\\'m very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas, endorsed me, because I think they see I\\'m trying to strengthen the anticrime legislation. We\\'ve got more money going out for local police than any previous administration.\\n\\nSo we\\'ve got to get it under control. And as one last point I\\'d make: drugs. We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs. We\\'re making some progress, doing a little better on interdiction. We\\'re not doing as well amongst the people that get to be habitual drug users. The good news is, and I think it\\'s true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine substantially, 60 percent in the last couple of years. So we\\'re making progress. But until we get that one done, we\\'re not going to solve the neighborhood crime problem.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Mr. Perot, there are young black males in America dying at unprecedented -- --\\n\\nMr. Perot. I would just make a comment on this.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Yes, I\\'m getting -- --\\n\\nMr. Perot. Oh, you\\'re going to elaborate. Okay, excuse me.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. -- -- to the fact that homicide is the leading cause of death among young black males, 15 to 24 years old. What are you going to do to get the guns off the street?\\n\\nMr. Perot. On any program, and this includes crime, you\\'ll find we have all kinds of great plans lying around that never get enacted into law and implemented. I don\\'t care what it is, competitiveness, health care, crime, you name it. The Brady bill, I agree that it\\'s a timid step in the right direction, but it won\\'t fix it. So why pass a law that won\\'t fix it?\\n\\nNow, what it really boils down to is can you live -- we have become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we have forgotten the rights of the innocent. In our country, we have evolved to a point where we\\'ve put millions of innocent people in jail, because you go to the poor neighborhoods and they\\'ve put bars on their windows and bars on their doors and put themselves in jail to protect the things that they acquired legitimately. Now, that\\'s where we are.\\n\\nWe have got to become more concerned about people who play by the rules and get the balance we require. This is going to take, first, building a consensus in grassroots America. Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it. And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans. And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you\\'re doing here tonight, build a consensus, and then do it and then go on to the next one. But don\\'t just sit here slow dancing for 4 years doing nothing.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Perot.\\n\\nWe have a question up here.\\n\\nTerm Limits\\n\\nQ. Please state your position on term limits. And if you are in favor of them, how will you get them enacted?\\n\\nPresident Bush. Any order? I\\'ll be glad to respond. I strongly support term limits for Members of the United States Congress. I believe it would return the Government closer to the people, the way that Ross Perot is talking about. The President\\'s terms are limited to two, a total of 8 years. What\\'s wrong with limiting the terms of Members of Congress to 12? Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized. For 38 years, one party has controlled the House of Representatives. And the result? A sorry little post office that can\\'t do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all of Chase Bank and Citibank put together.\\n\\nWe\\'ve got to do something about it. I think you get a certain arrogance, bureaucratic arrogance if people stay there too long. So I favor, strongly favor term limits. And how to get them passed? Send us some people that will pass the idea, and I think you will. I think the American people want it now. Everyplace I go, I talk about it, and I think they want it done.\\n\\nActually, you\\'d have to have some amendments to the Constitution because of the way the Constitution reads.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton?\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. I know they\\'re popular, but I\\'m against them. I\\'ll tell you why. I believe, number one, it would pose a real problem for a lot of smaller States in the Congress who would have enough trouble now making sure their interests are heard. Number two, I think it would increase the influence of unelected staff members in the Congress who have too much influence already. I want to cut the size of the congressional staffs, but I think you\\'re going to have too much influence there with people who were never elected who have lots of expertise.\\n\\nNumber three, if the people really have a mind to change, they can. You\\'re going to have 120 to 150 new Members of Congress. Now, let me tell you what I favor instead. I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we\\'re doing now. If you did that, you could take away the incumbent\\'s advantage, because challengers like me would have a chance to run against incumbents like him for the House races and Senate races, and then the voters could make up their own mind without being subject to an unfair fight. So that\\'s how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we\\'d get the changes you want.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Mr. Perot, would you like to address term limitations?\\n\\nMr. Perot. Yes. Let me do it first on a personal level. If the American people send me up to do this job, I intend to be there one term. I do not intend to spend one minute of one day thinking about reelection. It is a matter of principle. My situation is unique, and I understand it. I will take absolutely no compensation. I go as their servant.\\n\\nNow, I have set as strong an example as I can. And at that point, when we sit down over at Capitol Hill -- tomorrow night I\\'m going to be talking about Government reform. It is a long subject; you wouldn\\'t let me finish tonight. If you want to hear it, you can get it tomorrow night. [Laughter] But the point is, you\\'ll hear it tomorrow night. But we have got to reform Government.\\n\\nIf you put term limits in and don\\'t reform Government, you won\\'t get the benefit you thought. It takes both. So we need to do the reforms and the term limits. And after we reform it, it won\\'t be a lifetime career opportunity. Good people will go serve and then go back to their homes, and not become foreign lobbyists and cash in at 30,000 bucks a month, and then take time off to run some President\\'s campaign.\\n\\nThey\\'re all nice people. They\\'re just in a bad system. I don\\'t think there are any villains, but boy, is the system rotten.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you very much.\\n\\nWe have a question over here.\\n\\nHealth Care Reform\\n\\nQ. I\\'d like to ask Governor Clinton, do you attribute the rising costs of health care to the medical profession itself, or do you think the problem lies elsewhere? And what specific proposals do you have to tackle this problem?\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. I\\'ve had more people talk to me about their health care problems, I guess, than anything else. All across America, people who have lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children -- so let me try to answer you in this way.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with the premise. We spend 30 percent more of our income than any nation on Earth on health care. And yet, we insure fewer people. We have 35 million people without any insurance at all, and I see them all the time. One hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years.\\n\\nSo if you analyze where we\\'re out of line with other countries you come up with the following conclusions: Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative costs, bureaucracy, and Government regulation that wouldn\\'t be spent in any other nation. So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody. Employers would cover their employees. Government would cover the unemployed.\\n\\nNumber two, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools. I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can\\'t keep raising drug prices at 3 times the rate of inflation. I think you have to take on medical fraud. I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine. I\\'ve recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines, that raises the presumption that they didn\\'t do anything wrong. I think you have to have a system of primary preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care.\\n\\nBut the key is to control the costs and maintain the quality. To do that, you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups, and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals from a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs. And I think there has to be -- I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this -- there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation plus population growth.\\n\\nNow, let me say, some people say we can\\'t do this, but Hawaii does it. They cover 98 percent of their people, and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America. So does Rochester, New York. They now have a plan to cover everybody, and their premiums are two-thirds the rest of the country. This is very important. It\\'s a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America. I\\'m going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my Presidency. It\\'s terribly important.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you. Sorry to cut you short, but, President Bush, health care reform.\\n\\nPresident Bush. I just have to say something. I don\\'t want to stampede -- Ross was very articulate. Across the country, I don\\'t want anybody to stampede to cut the President\\'s salary off altogether. Barbara is sitting over here, and I -- [laughter] -- but what I have proposed, 10 percent cut, downsize the Government, and we can get that done.\\n\\nShe asked the question, I think, is whether the health care profession was to blame. No. One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits. They are breaking the system. It costs $20 to $25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped. Doctors don\\'t dare to deliver babies sometimes because they\\'re afraid that somebody\\'s going to sue them. People don\\'t dare, medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt because they\\'re afraid that some lawyer\\'s going to come along and get a big lawsuit.\\n\\nSo you can\\'t blame the practitioners or the health -- and my program is this: Keep the Government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor through vouchers, next range in the income bracket through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance. A great, big company can buy -- Ross has got a good size company, been very successful. He can buy insurance cheaper than mom-and-pop stores on the corner. But if those mom-and-pop stores all get together and pool, they, too, can bring the cost of insurance down.\\n\\nSo I want to keep the quality of health care. That means keep Government out of it. I don\\'t like this idea of these boards. It all sounds to me like you\\'re going to have some Government setting price. I want competition, and I want to pool the insurance and take care of it that way.\\n\\nHere\\'s the other point. I think medical care should go with the person. If you leave a business, I think your insurance should go with you to some other business. You shouldn\\'t be worrying if you get a new job as to whether that\\'s going to -- and part of our plan is to make it what they call portable, big word, but that means if you\\'re working for the Jones Company and you go to the Smith Company, your insurance goes with you. I think it\\'s a good program. I\\'m really excited about getting it done, too.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Mr. Perot?\\n\\nMr. Perot. We have the most expensive health care system in the world. Twelve percent of our gross national product goes to health care. Our industrial competitors, who are beating us in competition, spend less and have better health care. Japan spends a little over 6 percent of its gross national product; Germany spends 8 percent.\\n\\nIt\\'s fascinating. You bought a front-row box seat, and you\\'re not happy with your health care. You\\'re saying tonight we\\'ve got bad health care but very expensive health care. Folks, here\\'s why. Go home and look in the mirror. You own this country, but you have no voice in it the way it\\'s organized now. If you want to have a high-risk experience comparable to bungee jumping -- [laughter] -- go into Congress sometime when they\\'re working on this kind of legislation, when the lobbyists are running up and down the halls. Wear your safety-toe shoes when you go. [Laughter] And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance. The facts are, you now have a Government that comes at you. You\\'re supposed to have a Government that comes from you.\\n\\nNow, there are all kinds of good ideas, brilliant ideas, terrific ideas on health care. None of them ever get implemented because -- let me give you an example. A Senator runs every 6 years. He\\'s got to raise 20,000 bucks a week to have enough money to run. Who\\'s he going to listen to, us or the folks running up and down the aisle with money, the lobbyists, the PAC money? He listens to them. Who do they represent? Health care industry. Not us.\\n\\nNow, you\\'ve got to have a Government that comes from you again. You\\'ve got to reassert your ownership in this country, and you\\'ve got to completely reform our Government. And at that point, they\\'ll just be like apples falling out of a tree. The programs will be good because the elected officials will be listening, too. I said the other night I was all ears and I would listen to any good idea. I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they\\'re all ears, too, and listen to you. Then you get what you want, and shouldn\\'t you? You paid for it. Why shouldn\\'t you get what you want as opposed to what some lobbyist cuts a deal, writes the little piece in the law, and it goes through. That\\'s the way the game\\'s played now. Until you change it, you\\'re going to be unhappy.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton, you wanted one brief point.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. One brief point. We have elections so people can make decisions about this. The point I want to make to you is, a bipartisan commission reviewed my plan and the Bush plan and concluded -- there were as many Republicans as Democratic health care experts on it -- they concluded that my plan would cover everybody, and his would leave 27 million behind by the year 2000, and that my plan in the next 12 years would save $2.2 trillion in public and private money to reinvest in this economy. The average family would save $1,200 a year under the plan that I offered, without any erosion in the quality of health care. So I ask you to look at that.\\n\\nYou have to vote for somebody with a plan. That\\'s what you have elections for. If people say, \"Well, he got elected to do this,\" and then the Congress says, \"Okay, I\\'m going to do it.\" That\\'s what the election was about.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Brief, Governor Clinton. Thank you.\\n\\nWe have a question right here.\\n\\nPersonal Impact of the Economy\\n\\nQ. Yes, how has the national debt personally affected each of your lives? And if it hasn\\'t, how can you honestly find a cure for the economic problems of the common people if you have no experience in what\\'s ailing them?\\n\\nMr. Perot. May I answer it?\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Well, Mr. Perot, yes, of course.\\n\\nMr. Perot. Who do you want to start with?\\n\\nQ. My question is for each of you, so -- --\\n\\nMr. Perot. Yes, it caused me to disrupt my private life and my business to get involved in this activity. That\\'s how much I care about it. Believe me, if you knew my family and if you knew the private life I have, you would agree in a minute that that\\'s a whole lot more fun than getting involved in politics.\\n\\nI have lived the American dream. I came from a very modest background. Nobody\\'s been luckier than I\\'ve been, all the way across the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children. It\\'s true of any family. But I want all the children, I want these young people up here to be able to start with nothing but an idea like I did and build a business. But they\\'ve got to have a strong basic economy. And if you\\'re in debt, it\\'s like having a ball and chain around you.\\n\\nI just figure as lucky as I\\'ve been, I owe it to them, and I owe it to the future generations. And on a very personal basis, I owe it to my children and grandchildren.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you, Mr. Perot.\\n\\nMr. President.\\n\\nPresident Bush. Well, I think the national debt affects everybody. Obviously, it has a lot to do with interest rates -- --\\n\\nMs. Simpson. She\\'s saying you personally.\\n\\nQ. You, on a personal basis, how has it affected you?\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Has it affected you personally?\\n\\nPresident Bush. Well, I\\'m sure it has. I love my grandchildren. I want to think that -- --\\n\\nQ. How?\\n\\nPresident Bush. I want to think that they\\'re going to be able to afford an education. I think that that\\'s an important part of being a parent. If the question -- maybe I get it wrong. Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt doesn\\'t affect them?\\n\\nQ. What I\\'m saying -- --\\n\\nPresident Bush. I\\'m not sure I get it. Help me with the question, and I\\'ll try to answer it.\\n\\nQ. Well, I\\'ve had friends that have been laid off in jobs -- --\\n\\nPresident Bush. Yes.\\n\\nQ. I know people who cannot afford to pay the mortgage on their homes, their car payment. I have personal problems with the national debt. But how has it affected you? And if you have no experience in it, how can you help us if you don\\'t know what we\\'re feeling?\\n\\nMs. Simpson. I think she means more the recession, the economic problems today the country faces rather than -- --\\n\\nPresident Bush. Well, listen, you ought to be in the White House for a day and hear what I hear and see what I see and read the mail I read and touch the people that I touch from time to time.\\n\\nI was in the Lomax AME Church. It\\'s a black church just outside of Washington, DC, and I read in the bulletin about teenage pregnancies, about the difficulty that families are having to make ends meet. I talked to parents. I mean, you\\'ve got to care. Everybody cares if people aren\\'t doing well. But I don\\'t think it\\'s fair to say you haven\\'t had cancer, therefore you don\\'t know what it\\'s like. I don\\'t think it\\'s fair to say, whatever it is, if you haven\\'t been hit by it personally. But everybody\\'s affected by the debt, because of the tremendous interest that goes into paying on that debt, everything\\'s more expensive. Everything comes out of your pocket and my pocket. So it\\'s that. But I think in terms of the recession, of course, you feel it when you\\'re President of the United States. That\\'s why I\\'m trying to do something about it by stimulating the export, investing more, better education system.\\n\\nThank you. I\\'m glad you clarified it.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. Tell me how it\\'s affected you again? You know people who have lost their jobs and lost their homes?\\n\\nQ. Yes.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. Well, I\\'ve been Governor of a small State for 12 years. I\\'ll tell you how it\\'s affected me. Every year, Congress and the President sign laws that make us do more things; it gives us less money to do it with. I see people in my State, middle class people, their taxes have gone up from Washington and their services have gone down, while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts.\\n\\nI have seen what\\'s happened in this last 4 years when, in my State, when people lose their jobs there\\'s a good chance I\\'ll know them by their names. When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it. When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them. And I\\'ve been out here for 13 months, meeting in meetings just like this ever since October with people like you all over America, people that have lost their jobs, lost their livelihood, lost their health insurance.\\n\\nWhat I want you to understand is, the national debt is not the only cause of that. It is because America has not invested in its people. It is because we have not grown. It is because we\\'ve had 12 years of trickle-down economics. We\\'ve gone from 1st to 12th in the world in wages. We\\'ve had 4 years where we\\'ve produced no private sector jobs. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago. It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory. And this decision you\\'re about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want, not just people saying, \"I want to go fix it,\" but what are we going to do.\\n\\nWhat I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, in American education, control American health care costs, and bring the American people together again.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you, Governor Clinton. We are a little more than halfway through this program, and I\\'m glad that we\\'re getting the diversity of questions that we are.\\n\\nAnd I don\\'t want to forget these folks on the wings over here, so let\\'s go over here. Do you have a question?\\n\\nEntitlement Programs\\n\\nQ. Yes, I do. My name is Ben Smith. I work in the financial field, counseling retirees. And I\\'m personally concerned about three major areas. One is the Social Security Administration or trust fund is projected to be insolvent by the year 2036. We\\'ve funded the trust fund with IOU\\'s in the form of Treasury bonds. The pension guaranty fund which backs up our private retirement plans for retirees is projected to be bankrupt by the year 2026, not to mention the cutbacks by private companies. And Medicare is projected to be bankrupt maybe as soon as 1997.\\n\\nI would like from each of you a specific response as to what you intend to do for retirees relative to these issues, not generalities but specifics, because I think they\\'re very disturbing issues.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. President Bush, may we start with you?\\n\\nPresident Bush. Well, the Social Security -- you\\'re an expert and I could, I\\'m sure, learn from you the details of the pension guaranty fund and the Social Security fund. The Social Security system was fixed, about 5 years, and I think it\\'s projected out to be sound beyond that. So at least we have time to work with it.\\n\\nBut on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going. Growth in the economy is going to add to the overall prosperity and wealth. I can\\'t give you a specific answer on pension guaranty fund. All I know is that we have firm Government credit to guarantee the pensions, and that is very important.\\n\\nBut the full faith in credit of the United States, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good. It\\'s still the most respected credit. So I would simply say, as these dates get close you\\'re going to have to reorganize and refix as we did with the Social Security fund. I think that\\'s the only answer. But the more immediate answer is to do what this lady was suggesting we do, and that is to get this deficit down and get on without adding to the woes, and then restructure.\\n\\nOne thing I\\'ve called for that has been stymied, and I\\'ll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation. It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages, and it\\'s a big fight. I don\\'t want to give my friend Ross another shot at me here, but I am fighting with the Congress to get this through.\\n\\nYou can\\'t just go up and say, \"I\\'m going to fix it.\" You\\'ve got some pretty strong-willed guys up there that argue with you. But that\\'s what the election\\'s about; I agree with the Governor. That\\'s what the election is about. Sound fiscal policy is the best answer, I think, to all the three problems you mentioned.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you.\\n\\nMr. Perot?\\n\\nMr. Perot. Just on a broad issue here. When you\\'re trying to solve a problem, you get the best plans. You have a raging debate about those plans. Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus. And if the plans are huge and complex, like health care, I would urge you to implement pilot programs. Like the older carpenter says, measure twice, cut once. Let\\'s make sure this thing\\'s as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting.\\n\\nThen, finally, our Government passes laws and freezes the plan in concrete. Anybody that\\'s ever built a successful business will tell you, you optimize, optimize, optimize after you put something into effect. The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them. Everybody knows how to fix them. There are people all over the Federal Government if they could just touch it with a screwdriver could fix it.\\n\\nNow, back over here. See, we\\'ve got a $4 trillion debt, and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it, or 70 percent of it, financed 5 years or less. Now, that\\'s another thing for you to think about when you go home tonight. You don\\'t finance long-term debt with short-term money. Why did our Government do it? To get the interest rates down. A one-percent increase in interest rates in that $2.8 trillion is $28 billion a year.\\n\\nNow, when you look at what Germany pays for money and what we don\\'t pay for money, you realize there\\'s quite a spread, right? You realize this is a temporary thing and there\\'s going to be another sucking sound that runs our deficit through the roof.\\n\\nYou know, and everybody\\'s ducking it so I\\'m going to say it, that we are not letting that surplus stay in the bank. We are not investing that surplus like a pension fund. We are spending that surplus to make the deficit look smaller to you than it really is. Now, that puts you in jail in corporate America if you kept books that way, but in Government it\\'s just kind of the way things are. That\\'s because it comes at you, not from you.\\n\\nNow then, that money needs to be -- they don\\'t even pay interest on it, they just write a note for the interest.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Mr. Perot, can you wrap it up?\\n\\nMr. Perot. Sure. But the point, see, do you want to fix the problem or sound-bite it? I understand the importance of time, but see, here\\'s how we get to this mess we\\'re in. This is just 1 of 1,000.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. But we\\'ve got to be fair.\\n\\nMr. Perot. Now then, to nail it, there\\'s one way out, a growing, expanding job base, a growing, expanding job base to generate the funds and the tax revenues to pay off the mess and rebuild America. We\\'ve got to double hit. If we\\'re $4 trillion down, we should have everything perfect, but we don\\'t. We\\'ve got to pay it off and build money to renew it, spend money to renew it, and that\\'s going to take a growing, expanding job base. That is priority one in this country. Put everybody that\\'s breathing to work. I\\'d love to be out of workers and have to import them, like some of our international competitors.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Mr. Perot, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m going to -- --\\n\\nMr. Perot. Sorry.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. And I don\\'t want to sound-bite you, but we are trying to be fair to everyone.\\n\\nMr. Perot. No, absolutely. I apologize.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. All right, Governor Clinton.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. I think I remember the question. [Laughter] Let me say first of all, I want to answer your specific question, but first of all, we all agree that there should be a growing economy. What you have to decide is who\\'s got the best economic plan. We all have ideas out there, and Mr. Bush has a record. I don\\'t want you to read my lips, and I sure don\\'t want you to read his. [Laughter] I do hope you will read our plans.\\n\\nNow, specifically -- --\\n\\nPresident Bush. [Inaudible] -- first rule?\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. -- -- one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it; there are different ideas. The Bush plan, the Perot plan, the Clinton -- we have different ideas. I am convinced, having studied health care for a year, hard, and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the costs of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets. You\\'ve got to do that. We\\'ve got to get those costs down.\\n\\nNumber two, with regard to Social Security, that program, a lot of you may not know this: It produces a $70 billion surplus a year. Social Security is in surplus $70 billion. Six increases in the payroll tax -- that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionately high share of the Federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle class tax relief.\\n\\nWhat do we have to do? By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up, so when the baby boomers like me retire, we\\'re okay.\\n\\nNumber three, on the pension funds, I don\\'t know as much about it, but I will say this: What I will do is to bring in the pension experts of the country, take a look at it, and strengthen the pension requirements further, because it\\'s not just enough to have the guarantee. We had a guarantee on the S&L\\'s, right? We had a guarantee, and what happened? You picked up a $500 billion bill because of the dumb way the Federal Government deregulated it. So I think we are going to have to change and strengthen the pension requirements on private retirement plans.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you. I think we have a question here on international affairs, hopefully.\\n\\nForeign Affairs\\n\\nQ. We\\'ve come to a position where we\\'re in the new world order. And I\\'d like to know what the candidates feel our position is in this new world order and what our responsibilities are as a superpower.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Mr. President?\\n\\nPresident Bush. We have come to that position. Since I became President, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic. No longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule. This is exciting. This new world order to me means freedom and democracy.\\n\\nI think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved. If we pull back in some isolation and say we don\\'t have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you\\'re going to just ask for conflagration that we\\'ll get involved in in the future. NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years. I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we\\'ll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe.\\n\\nBut the exciting thing is the fear of nuclear war is down. You hear all the bad stuff that\\'s happened on my watch. I hope people will recognize that this is something pretty good for mankind. I hope they\\'ll think it\\'s good that democracy and freedom is on the move. And we\\'re going to stay engaged, as long as I am President, working to improve things.\\n\\nYou know, it\\'s so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we\\'ve got a problem at home. I think the United States has to still have the Statue of Liberty as a symbol of caring for others. We\\'re right this very minute, we\\'re sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia. It\\'s the United States that\\'s taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia. We\\'re doing this all around the world.\\n\\nAnd yes, we\\'ve got problems at home. I think I\\'ve got a good plan to help fix those problems at home. But because of our leadership, because we didn\\'t listen to the freeze, the nuclear freeze group -- do you remember: \"Freeze it,\" back in about in the late seventies. \"Freeze, don\\'t touch it. We\\'re going to lock it in now, or else we\\'ll have war.\" President Reagan said, \"No. Peace through strength.\" It worked. The Soviet Union is no more. Now we\\'re working to help them become totally democratic through the FREEDOM Support Act that I led on. A great Democratic Ambassador, Bob Strauss over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed, through cooperation, Ross. It worked with cooperation. And you\\'re for that, I\\'m sure, helping Russia become democratic.\\n\\nSo the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation. We are the United States, and we have a responsibility to lead and to guarantee the security. If it hadn\\'t been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world, and he\\'d have nuclear weapons. Only the United States could do this.\\n\\nExcuse me, Carole.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you.\\n\\nMr. Perot.\\n\\nMr. Perot. Well, it\\'s cost-effective to help Russia succeed in its revolution. It\\'s pennies on the dollar compared to going back to the cold war. Russia\\'s still very unstable. They could go back to square one and worse. All the nuclear weapons are not dismantled. I\\'m particularly concerned about the intercontinental weapons, the ones that can hit us. We\\'ve got agreements, but they\\'re still there. With all this instability and breaking into Republics and all the Middle Eastern countries going over there and shopping for weapons, we\\'ve got our work cut out for us. So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism.\\n\\nWe have to have money to do that. We have to have our people at work. See, for 45 years, we were preoccupied with the Red Army. I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink in our country. And we\\'ve got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia.\\n\\nWe cannot be the policeman for the world any longer. We spend $300 billion a year defending the world. Germany and Japan spend around $30 billion apiece. It\\'s neat. If I can get you to defend me and I can spend all my money building industry, that\\'s a home run for me. Coming out of World War II, it made sense. Now the other superpowers need to do their part.\\n\\nI\\'ll close on this point: You can\\'t be a superpower unless you\\'re an economic superpower. If we\\'re not an economic superpower, we are a used-to-be, and we will no longer be a force for good throughout the world. If nothing else gets you excited about rebuilding our industrial base, maybe that will, because job one is to put our people back to work.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Governor Clinton, the President mentioned Saddam Hussein. Your vice president and you have had some words about the President and Saddam Hussein. Would you care to comment?\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. I\\'d rather answer her question first, and then I\\'ll be glad to, because the question you ask is important. The end of the cold war brings an incredible opportunity for change, the winds of freedom blowing around the world, Russia demilitarizing. It also requires us to maintain some continuity, some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles.\\n\\nI would just say there are three things that I would like to say. Number one, we do have to maintain the world\\'s strongest defense. We may differ about what the elements of that are. I think the defense needs to be with fewer people and permanent armed services, but with greater mobility on the land, in the air, and on the sea, with a real dedication to continuing development of high-technology weaponry and well-trained people. I think we\\'re going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We\\'ve got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other Republics.\\n\\nNumber two, if you don\\'t rebuild the economic strength of this country at home, we won\\'t be a superpower. We can\\'t have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese Prime Minister said he felt sympathy for our country. We have to be the strongest economic power in the world. That\\'s what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy.\\n\\nNumber three, we need to be a force for freedom and democracy. We need to use our unique position to support freedom, whether it\\'s in Haiti or in China or in any other place, wherever the seeds of freedom are sprouting. We can\\'t impose it, but we need to nourish it. That\\'s the kind of thing that I would do as President, follow those three commitments into the future.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Okay, we have a question up there.\\n\\nEducation\\n\\nQ. We\\'ve talked a lot tonight about creating jobs. But we have an awful lot of high school graduates who don\\'t know how to read a ruler, who cannot fill out an application for a job. How can we create high-paying jobs with the education system we have? And what would you do to change it?\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Who would like to begin? The education President?\\n\\nPresident Bush. I\\'d be delighted to, because you can\\'t do it the old way. You can\\'t do it with the school bureaucracy controlling everything. And that\\'s why we have a new program that I hope people have heard about. It\\'s being worked now in 1,700 communities -- I bypassed Congress on this one, Ross -- 1,700 communities across the country. It\\'s called America 2000. It literally says to the communities: Reinvent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else. Think anew. We have a concept called the New American School Corporation, where we\\'re doing exactly that.\\n\\nSo I believe that we\\'ve got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers union -- what\\'s happening up there? [Laughter] So our America 2000 program also says this: It says let\\'s give parents the choice of a public, private, or religious school. And it works. It works in Milwaukee. A Democratic woman up there taking the lead in this, the Mayor up there on the program, and the schools that are not chosen are improved. Competition does that.\\n\\nSo we\\'ve got to innovate through school choice. We\\'ve got to innovate through this America 2000 program. But she is absolutely right. The programs that we\\'ve been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don\\'t work.\\n\\nThe Governors -- and I believe Governor Clinton was in on this, but I don\\'t want to invoke him here -- but they come to me, and they say, please get the Congress to stop passing so many mandates telling us how to control things. We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is. So this is what our program is all about. I believe -- you\\'re right onto something -- that if we don\\'t change the education, we\\'re not going to be able to compete.\\n\\nFederal funding for education is up substantially. Pell Grants are up. But it isn\\'t going to get the job done if we don\\'t change K through 12.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Governor Clinton?\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. First of all, let me say that I\\'ve spent more of my time in life on this in the last 12 years than any other issue. Seventy percent of my State\\'s money goes to public schools. I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other State in the country except one other. They named two States showing real strides forward in the eighties. So I care a lot about this, and I\\'ve spent countless hours in schools.\\n\\nBut let me start with what you\\'ve said. I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it\\'s nowhere near enough. We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18-year-old will change jobs eight times in a lifetime, and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on. Nobody running can promise that. There\\'s too much change in the world.\\n\\nSo what should we do? Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics. Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to States to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job a chance to get a high school diploma, in big places, on the job.\\n\\nNumber two, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don\\'t go to college, in community colleges or on the job.\\n\\nNumber three, we\\'d open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income. They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income over the couple of years of service to our Nation here home.\\n\\nNumber four, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start.\\n\\nFive, I would have an aggressive program of school reform. More choices in the -- I favor public schools or these new charter schools. We can talk about that if you want. I don\\'t think we should spend tax money on private schools, but I favor public school choice. I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools. Those things would revolutionize American education and take us to the top economically.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you, Governor Clinton. What the question is -- what is it going to cost?\\n\\nQ. What is it going to cost?\\n\\nMs. Simpson. What is it going to cost?\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. In 6 years -- I budget all this in my budget. In 6 years, the college program would cost $8 billion over and above what -- the present student loan program costs 4. You pay $3 billion for busted loans, because we don\\'t have an automatic recovery system, and a billion dollars in bank fees. So the net cost will be $8 billion 6 years from now, in a trillion-plus budget: not very much.\\n\\nThe other stuff, all the other stuff I mentioned costs much less than that. The Head Start program, full funding, would cost about $5 billion more. It\\'s all covered in my budget from the plans that I\\'ve laid out, from raising taxes on families with incomes above $200,000, and asking foreign corporations to pay the same tax that American corporations do on the same income; from $140 billion in budget cuts, including what I think are very prudent cuts in the defense budget. It\\'s all covered in the plan.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Mr. Perot, you on education, please.\\n\\nMr. Perot. Yes. I\\'ve got scars to show from being around education reform. The first words you need to say in every city and State and just draw a line in the sand -- public schools exist for the benefit of the children -- you\\'re going to see a lot of people fall over it, because any time you\\'re spending $199 billion a year, somebody\\'s getting it, and the children get lost in the process. So that\\'s step one.\\n\\nKeep in mind in 1960 when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them. Now we spend more than any other nation in the world, $199 billion a year, and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of educational achievement. One more time, you\\'ve bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance. This is a Government that\\'s not serving you.\\n\\nBy and large, it should be local. The more local, the better. Interesting phenomenon, small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools. The best people in a small town will serve on the school board. You get into big cities, it\\'s political patronage, stepping stones. You get the job, give your relatives the janitor\\'s job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make. And with luck, they clean the cafeteria once a week. [Laughter]\\n\\nNow, you\\'re paying for that. Those schools belong to you, and we put up with that. As long as you put up with that, that\\'s what you\\'re going to get. These folks are just dividing up 199 billion bucks, and the children get lost.\\n\\nIf I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home. Nothing will ever replace that. You say, \"Well, gee, what are you going to do about that?\" Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day. There\\'s nothing -- the most efficient unit of Government we\\'ll ever know is a strong, loving family unit.\\n\\nNext thing. You need small schools, not big schools. A little school, everybody\\'s somebody. Individualism is very important. These big factories, everybody told me they were cost-effective. I did a study on it. They\\'re cost-ineffective. Five thousand students: why is a high school that big? One reason. Sooner or later, you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil, that weigh 250 pounds, and they might win district. Now, that has nothing to do with learning.\\n\\nSecondly, across Texas, typically half the school day was nonacademic pursuits. In one place, it was 35 percent. In Texas, you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows. Found a boy -- excuse me, but this gives the flavor -- a boy in Houston kept a chicken in the bathtub in downtown Houston. Missed 65 days going to livestock shows. Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost his feathers. That\\'s the only way we got him back. [Laughter] Now, that\\'s your tax money being wasted.\\n\\nNow, neighborhood schools. It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town. It is particularly terrible to take poor, tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage; the end of the first day, that little child wants out.\\n\\nI close on this: You\\'ve got to have world-class teachers, world-class books. If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldn\\'t want to go back the second day. I don\\'t have time to tell you the stories. [Laughter]\\n\\nMs. Simpson. No, you don\\'t. [Laughter]\\n\\nMr. Perot. Finally. If we don\\'t fix this, you\\'re right, we can\\'t have the industries of tomorrow unless we have the best educated work force. And here, for the disadvantaged children, you\\'ve got to have early childhood development, the cheapest money you\\'ll ever spend. The first contact should be with the mother when she\\'s pregnant. That little child needs to be loved and hugged and nurtured and made to feel special, like you children were. They learn to think well or poorly of themselves in the first 18 months.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you, Mr. Perot.\\n\\nMr. Perot. Within the first few years, they either learn how to learn or don\\'t learn how to learn. If they don\\'t, they wind up in prison, and it costs more to keep them in prison than it does to send them to Harvard. I rest my case.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you. President Bush, you wanted to add something.\\n\\nPresident Bush. I just had a word of clarification because of something Governor Clinton said. My school choice program, \"GI bill\" for kids, does not take public money and give it to private schools. It does what the GI bill itself did when I came out of World War II. It takes public money and gives it to families or individuals to choose the school they want. Where it\\'s been done, those schools, like in Rochester, those schools that weren\\'t chosen find that they then compete and do better. So I think it\\'s worth a shot.\\n\\nWe\\'ve got a pilot program. It ought to be tried: school choice, public, private, or religious, not to the schools, but to -- 46 percent of the teachers in Chicago, public schoolteachers, send their kids to private school. Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think, make all schools better.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. I just want to mention if I could -- --\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Very briefly.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. Very briefly. Involving the parents in the preschool education of their kids, even if they\\'re poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference. We have a big program in my State that teaches mothers or fathers to teach their kids to get ready for school. It\\'s the most successful thing we\\'ve ever done.\\n\\nJust a fact clarification real quickly. We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than every other country. There are nine countries that spend more than we do on public education. We spend more on education because we spend so much more on colleges. But if you look at public education alone, and you take into account that we have more racial diversity and more poverty, it makes a big difference. There are great public schools where there are public school choice, accountability, and brilliant principals. I\\'ll just mention one, the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago. I commend it to anybody. It\\'s as good as any private school in the country.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. We have very little time left, and it occurs to me that we have talked all this time and there has not been one question about some of the racial tensions and ethnic tensions in America. Is there anyone in this audience that would like to pose a question to the candidates on this? Yes?\\n\\nWomen or Minority Presidential Candidates\\n\\nQ. What I\\'d like to know, and this is to any of the three of you, is aside from the recent accomplishments of your party, aside from those accomplishments in racial representation and without citing any of your current appointments or successful elections, when do you estimate your party will both nominate and elect an Afro-American and female ticket to the Presidency of the United States?\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Governor Clinton, why don\\'t you answer that first.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. Well, I don\\'t have any idea, but I hope it will happen sometime in my lifetime.\\n\\nQ. I do, too.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. I believe that this country is electing more and more African-Americans and Latinos and Asian-Americans who are representing districts that are themselves not necessarily of a majority of their race. The American people are beginning to vote across racial lines, and I hope it will happen more and more.\\n\\nMore and more women are being elected. Look at all these women Senate candidates we have here. You know, according to my mother and my wife and my daughter, this world would be a lot better place if women were running it most of the time.\\n\\nI do think there are special experiences and judgments and backgrounds and understandings that women bring to this process, by the way. This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy? I mean, women know what it\\'s like to be paid an unequal amount for equal work; they know what\\'s it like not to have flexible working hours; they know what it\\'s like not to have family leave or child care. So I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened, and I think it will happen in my lifetime.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Okay. I\\'m sorry we have just a little bit of time left. Let\\'s try to get responses from each of them.\\n\\nPresident Bush or Mr. Perot?\\n\\nPresident Bush. I think if Barbara Bush were running this year she\\'d be elected. [Laughter] But it\\'s too late.\\n\\nYou don\\'t want us to mention appointees but when you see the quality of people in our administration, see how Colin Powell performed -- I say administration, he\\'s in the military.\\n\\nQ. I said when\\'s your guess?\\n\\nPresident Bush. You weren\\'t impressed with the fact that he performed -- --\\n\\nQ. Excuse me, I\\'m extremely impressed with that.\\n\\nPresident Bush. Yes, but wouldn\\'t that suggest to the American people then here\\'s a quality person, if he decided that he could automatically -- --\\n\\nQ. Sure. I just wanted to know -- --\\n\\nPresident Bush. -- -- get the nomination of either party? Huh?\\n\\nQ. I\\'m totally impressed with that. I just wanted to know is when is your guess of when.\\n\\nPresident Bush. Oh, I see. You mean time?\\n\\nQ. Yeah.\\n\\nPresident Bush. I don\\'t know. Starting after 4 years. [Laughter] No, I think you\\'ll see -- --\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Mr. Perot?\\n\\nPresident Bush. I think you\\'ll see more minority candidates and women candidates coming forward.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you.\\n\\nPresident Bush. This is supposed to be the year of the women in the Senate. Let\\'s see how they do. I hope a lot of them lose.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Mr. Perot, I don\\'t want to cut you up any more, but we only have a minute left.\\n\\nMr. Perot. I have a fearless forecast. Unless he just won\\'t do it, Colin Powell will be on somebody\\'s ticket 4 years from now. Right? Right? You wanted -- that\\'s it. Four years.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. How about a woman?\\n\\nMr. Perot. Now, if he won\\'t be, General Waller would be a -- you say, why do you keep picking military people? These are people that I just happened to know and have a high regard for. I\\'m sure there are hundreds of others.\\n\\nPresident Bush. How about Dr. Lou Sullivan?\\n\\nMr. Perot. Absolutely.\\n\\nPresident Bush. Yeah, good man.\\n\\nMr. Perot. Absolutely.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. What about a woman?\\n\\nMr. Perot. Oh, oh.\\n\\nPresident Bush. My candidate\\'s right back there.\\n\\nMr. Perot. I can think of many.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Many?\\n\\nMr. Perot. Absolutely.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. When?\\n\\nMr. Perot. How about Sandra Day O\\'Connor as an example? Dr. Bernadine Healy.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Good.\\n\\nMr. Perot. National Institutes of Health. All right, I\\'ll yield the floor. Name some more.\\n\\nPresident Bush. Good Republicans. [Laughter]\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you. I want to apologize to our audience because there were 209 people here, and there were 209 questions. We only got to a fraction of them, and I\\'m sorry to those of you that didn\\'t get to ask your questions, but we must move to the conclusion of the program.\\n\\nIt is time now for the 2-minute closing statements. By prior agreement, President Bush will go first.\\n\\nClosing Statements\\n\\nPresident Bush. May I ask for an exception because I think we owe Carole Simpson a -- anybody who can stand in between these three characters here and get the job done -- we owe her a round of applause. [Applause] Just don\\'t take it out of my time.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. That\\'s right.\\n\\nPresident Bush. I feel strongly about it, but I don\\'t want it to come out of my time.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. That\\'s right. [Laughter]\\n\\nPresident Bush. No, but let me just say to the American people: In 2 1/2 weeks, we\\'re going to choose who should sit in this Oval Office, who to lead the economic recovery, who to be the leader of the free world, who to get the deficit down. Three ways to do that: one is to raise taxes; one is to reduce spending, controlling that mandatory spending; another one is to invest and save and to stimulate growth.\\n\\nI do not want to raise taxes. I differ with the two here on that. I\\'m just not going to do that. I do believe that we need to control mandatory spending. I think we need to invest and save more. I believe that we need to educate better and retrain better. I believe that we need to export more, so I\\'ll keep working for export agreements where we can sell more abroad. And I believe that we must strengthen the family. We\\'ve got to strengthen the family.\\n\\nNow, let me pose this question to America: If in the next 5 minutes a television announcer came on and said, there is a major international crisis, there is a major threat to the world, or in this country a major threat, my question is, if you were appointed to name one of the three of us, who would you choose? Who has the perseverance, the character, the integrity, the maturity to get the job done? I hope I\\'m that person.\\n\\nThank you very, very much.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you, Mr. President. And now a closing statement from Mr. Perot.\\n\\nMr. Perot. If the American people want to do it and not talk about it, then I\\'m one person they ought to consider. If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I\\'m not your man. I am results oriented. I am action oriented. I\\'ve built my businesses getting things done in 3 months that my competitors took 18 months to do.\\n\\nEverybody says, you can\\'t do that with Congress. Sure you can do that with Congress. Congress, they\\'re all good people. They\\'re all patriots. But you\\'ve got to link arms and work with them. Sure, you\\'ll have arguments. Sure, you\\'ll have fights. We have them all day, every day. But we get the job done.\\n\\nNow, I have to come back in my close to one thing, because I am passionate about education. I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children. Let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don\\'t have a chance go to this program when they\\'re 3. Now, we\\'re going back to when the mother is pregnant, and they\\'ll start right after they\\'re born, starting when they\\'re 3 and going to this school until they\\'re 9, and then going into the public school in the fourth grade -- 90 percent are on the honor roll. Now, that will change America. Those children will all go to college. They will live the American dream.\\n\\nI beg the American people, anytime they think about reforming education, to take this piece of society that doesn\\'t have a chance, and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children. Teach them that they\\'re unique and that they\\'re precious and there\\'s only one person in the world like them, and you will see this Nation bloom. We will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific.\\n\\nNow, finally, if you can\\'t pay the bills, you\\'re dead in the water. We have got to put our Nation back to work. Now, if you don\\'t want to really do that, I\\'m not your man. I\\'d go crazy sitting up there slow dancing that one. In other words, unless we\\'re going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it.\\n\\nNow, just remember, when you think about me, I didn\\'t create this mess. I\\'ve been paying taxes just like you. And Lord knows, I\\'ve paid my share, over $1 billion in taxes. And for a guy that started out with everything he owned in the trunk of his car, that ain\\'t bad.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. I\\'m sorry, Mr. Perot. Once again -- --\\n\\nMr. Perot. But it\\'s in your hands. I wish you well. I\\'ll see you tomorrow night on NBC, 10:30 p.m., 11 p.m., eastern. [Laughter]\\n\\nMs. Simpson. And finally, last but not least, Governor Clinton.\\n\\nGovernor Clinton. Thank you, Carole, and thank you, ladies and gentleman. Since I suggested this format, I hope it\\'s been good for all of you. I\\'ve really tried to be faithful to your request that we answer the questions specifically and pointedly. I thought I owed that to you. And I respect you for being here, and for the impact you\\'ve had on making this a more positive experience.\\n\\nThese problems are not easy. They\\'re not going to be solved overnight. But I want you to think about just two or three things. First of all, the people of my State have let me be their Governor for 12 years because I made commitments to two things, more jobs and better schools.\\n\\nOur schools are now better. Our children get off to a better start, from preschool programs and smaller classes in the early grades. We have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country. We talked about that.\\n\\nThis year, my State ranks first in the country in job growth, fourth in manufacturing job growth, fourth in income growth, fourth in the decline of poverty. I\\'m proud of that. It happened because I could work with people, Republicans and Democrats. That\\'s why we\\'ve had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign.\\n\\nYou have to decide whether you want to change or not. We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn\\'t work. We\\'ve had 12 years of trickle-down economics. It\\'s time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy. I\\'m the only person here who\\'s ever balanced a government budget, and I\\'ve presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly. But you cannot just get there by balancing the budget. We\\'ve got to grow the economy by putting people first, real people like you.\\n\\nI got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than their parents. We\\'re better than that. We can do better than that. I want to make America as great as it can be, and I ask for your help in doing it.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nMs. Simpson. Thank you, Governor Clinton.\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the debate, sponsored by the Bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. I\\'d like to thank our audience of 209 uncommitted voters who may leave this evening maybe being committed. And hopefully, they\\'ll go to the polls like everyone else on November 3d and vote.\\n\\nWe invite you to join us on the third and final Presidential debate next Monday, October 19th, from the campus of Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan.\\n\\nI\\'m Carole Simpson. Good night.'}, {'file': '84_debate_1', 'content': 'Ms. Ridings. Good evening from the Kentucky Center for the Arts in Louisville, Kentucky. I\\'m Dorothy Ridings, president of the League of Women Voters, the sponsor of tonight\\'s first Presidential debate between Republican Ronald Reagan and Democrat Walter Mondale.\\n\\nTonight\\'s debate marks the third consecutive Presidential election in which the League is presenting the candidates for the Nation\\'s highest office in face-to-face debate.\\n\\nOur panelists are James Wieghart, national political correspondent for Scripps-Howard News Service; Diane Sawyer, correspondent for the CBS program \"60 Minutes;\" and Fred Barnes, national political correspondent for the Baltimore Sun. Barbara Walters of ABC News, who is appearing in her fourth Presidential debate, is our moderator.\\n\\nBarbara.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you, Dorothy.\\n\\nA few words as we begin tonight\\'s debate about the format. The position of the candidates-that is, who answers questions first and who gives the last statement--was determined by a toss of a coin between the two candidates. Mr. Mondale won, and that means that he chose to give the final closing statement. It means, too, that the President will answer the first question first. I hope that\\'s clear. If it isn\\'t, it will become clear as the debate goes on.\\n\\nFurther, the candidates will be addressed as they each wanted and will, therefore, be called \"Mr. President\" and \"Mr. Mondale.\"\\n\\nSince there will also be a second debate between the two Presidential candidates, tonight will focus primarily on the economy and other domestic issues. The debate, itself, is built around questions from the panel. In each of its segments, a reporter will ask the candidates the same general question. Then--and this is important-each candidate will have the chance to rebut what the other has said. And the final segment of the debate will be the closing segment, and the candidates will each have 4 minutes for their closing statements. And as I have said, Mr. Mondale will be the last person on the program to speak.\\n\\nAnd now I would like to add a personal note if I may. As Dorothy Ridings pointed out, I have been involved now in four Presidential debates, either as a moderator or as a panelist. In the past, there was no problem in selecting panelists. Tonight, however, there were to have been four panelists participating in this debate.\\n\\nThe candidates were given a list of almost 100 qualified journalists from all the media and could agree on only these three fine journalists. As moderator, and on behalf of my fellow journalists, I very much regret, as does the League of Women Voters, that this situation has occurred.\\n\\nAnd now let us begin the debate with the first question from James Wieghart.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart.\\n\\nThe Nation\\'s Economy\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. President, in 1980 you promised the American people--in your campaign--a balanced budget by 1983. We\\'ve now had more and bigger deficits in the 4 years you\\'ve been in office. Mr. President, do you have a secret plan to balance the budget sometime in a second term, and if so, would you lay out that plan for us tonight?\\n\\nThe President. I have a plan--not a secret plan. As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.\\n\\nIt is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us--the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing. Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget--no, that was no longer possible.\\n\\nSo, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy.\\n\\nAlready, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion. Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.\\n\\nOur tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery. We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was. The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further. In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs--there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.\\n\\nSo, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending--the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet. And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has some bad news. The lines aren\\'t about to meet, according to their projections. They project that the budget deficit will continue to climb. In the year 1989 they project a budget deficit of $273 billion.\\n\\nIn view of that, and in view of the economic recovery we are now enjoying, would it make sense to propose a tax increase or take some other fiscal measures to reduce that deficit now, when times are relatively good?\\n\\nThe President. The deficit is the result of excessive government spending. I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasn\\'t going to take place to begin with. But it has taken place.\\n\\nBut, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent. If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent-we\\'re not far from there--by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level. At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean--without an increase in tax rates--that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues. And so, I think that the lines can meet.\\n\\nActually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. Mondale, the Carter-Mondale administration didn\\'t come close to balancing the budget in its 4 years in office either, despite the fact that President Carter did promise a balanced budget during his term.\\n\\nYou have proposed a plan combining tax increases and budgetary cuts and other changes in the administration of the Government that would reduce the projected budget deficit by two-thirds, to approximately $87 billion in 1989. That still is an enormous deficit that will be running for these 4 years. What other steps do you think should be taken to reduce this deficit and position the country for economic growth?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation. And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.\\n\\nI respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that. But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars. As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they\\'ve missed the mark by nearly $600 billion. We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983. It was $200 billion deficit instead. And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we\\'ll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.\\n\\nVirtually every economic analysis that I\\'ve heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit. In other words, it doesn\\'t converge as the President suggests. It gets larger even with growth.\\n\\nWhat that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade. This is the worst trade year in American history by far. Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation. Real interest rates--the real cost of interest-will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we\\'re moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession. I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that\\'s fair. I\\'ve stood up and told the American people that I think it\\'s a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I\\'ve told you what I think should be done.\\n\\nI think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. Mondale, one other way to attack the deficit is further reductions in spending. The President has submitted a number of proposals to Congress to do just that, and in many instances the House, controlled by the Democrats, has opposed them. Isn\\'t it one aspect of leadership for prominent Democrats such as yourself to encourage responsible reductions in spending, and thereby reduce the deficit?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things-- [applause] --that people need. These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I\\'m not going to do it that way.\\n\\nThe rate of defense spending increase can be slowed. Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7,000. And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life. And that\\'s why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President\\'s recommendations.\\n\\nMs. Walters. I would like to ask the audience please to refrain from applauding either side; it just takes away from the time for your candidates.\\n\\nAnd now it is time for the rebuttal. Mr. President, 1 minute for rebuttal.\\n\\nThe President. Yes. I don\\'t believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes. And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation\\'s history took place 1977. And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion. So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget. Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you\\'re taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government\\'s share of what it is taking.\\n\\nWith regard to Social Security, I hope there\\'ll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say \"never.\" But I\\'m going to violate that rule and say \"never.\" I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. Mondale?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Well, that\\'s exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits. And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent-reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying--with widows trying to get them through college. Everybody remembers that; people know what happened.\\n\\nThere\\'s a difference. I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you very much. We\\'ll now begin with segment number two with my colleague, Diane Sawyer.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer?\\n\\nLeadership Qualities\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. Mr. President, Mr. Mondale, the public opinion polls do suggest that the American people are most concerned about the personal leadership characteristics of the two candidates, and each of you has questioned the other\\'s leadership ability. Mr. President, you have said that Mr. Mondale\\'s leadership would take the country down the path of defeatism and despair, and Vice President Bush has called him whining and hoping for bad news. And, Mr. Mondale, you have said that President Reagan offers showmanship, not leadership, that he has not mastered what he must know to command his government.\\n\\nI\\'d like to ask each of you to substantiate your claims--Mr. Mondale first. Give us specifics to support your claim that President Reagan is a showman, not a leader; has not mastered what he must know to be President after 4 years, and then, second, tell us what personal leadership characteristics you have that he does not.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I\\'m saying. There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil. And it\\'s also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.\\n\\nThe President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason. No one else believes that\\'s the case. I do, and I\\'m standing up to the issue with an answer that\\'s fair. I think that\\'s what leadership is all about. There\\'s a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there\\'s a real problem, a President must confront it.\\n\\nWhat I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon. Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions. The first time--and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen--once, and sometimes twice-the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember. There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.\\n\\nNow, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him. It\\'s the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done. I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what\\'s needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead. And that\\'s why in this campaign I\\'m telling you exactly what I want to do. I am answering your questions. I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. You have said, Mr. Mondale, that the polls have given you lower ratings on leadership than President Reagan because your message has failed to get through. Given that you have been in public office for so many years, what accounts for the failure of your message to get through?\\n\\nMr, Mondale. Well, I think we\\'re getting better all the time. And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other. And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is. He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. Mr. President, the issue is leadership in personal terms. First, do you think, as Vice President Bush said, that Mr. Mondale\\'s campaign is one of whining and hoping for bad news? And second, what leadership characteristics do you possess that Mr. Mondale does not?\\n\\nThe President. Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you\\'ve asked it. And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security-before I get to the answer to your question--the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.\\n\\nNow, leadership. First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in. In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society--that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.\\n\\nNow, having that, I think also that in leadership--well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I\\'m in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government. I don\\'t believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who\\'s going to play tennis on the White House court. And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job. You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.\\n\\nBut I also believe something else about that. I believe that--and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office--that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue. I don\\'t want to hear them. I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people--is it morally right? And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.\\n\\nNow, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren\\'t to be abhorred--that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. As a followup, let me draw in another specific, if I could--a specific that the Democrats have claimed about your campaign--that it is essentially based on imagery. And one specific that they allege is that, for instance, recently you showed up at the opening ceremony of a Buffalo old-age housing project, when in fact, your policy was to cut Federal housing subsidies for the elderly. Yet you were there to have your picture taken with them.\\n\\nThe President. Our policy was not to cut subsidies. We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure. And this is what we\\'ve been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships.\\n\\nWe are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we\\'re going to continue along that line. We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need. We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need. The safety net is there, and we\\'re taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. Mondale, an opportunity for you to rebut.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Well, I guess I\\'m reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover. He said, \"It\\'s not what he doesn\\'t know that bothers me; it\\'s what he knows for sure that just ain\\'t so.\" [Laughter] The fact of it is: The President\\'s budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent. It\\'s not an opinion; it\\'s a fact. And when the President was asked the other day, \"What do you want to cut in the budget?\", he said, \"Cut those things I asked for but didn\\'t get.\" That\\'s Social Security and Medicare.\\n\\nThe second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President\\'s budget sought to terminate. So, if he\\'d had his way, there wouldn\\'t have been any housing project there at all. This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there. We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. President?\\n\\nThe President. Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security. When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn\\'t solve them for 5. Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.\\n\\nAny proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce. And so, we made a proposal. And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign. And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke. Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks. And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I\\'d asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution.\\n\\nAnd so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. President, we begin segment number three with Fred Barnes.\\n\\nReligion\\n\\nMr. Barnes. Mr. President, would you describe your religious beliefs, noting particularly whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how these beliefs affect your Presidential decisions?\\n\\nThe President. Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy. In our particular church, we did not use that term, \"born again,\" so I don\\'t know whether I would fit that--that particular term. But I have--thanks to my mother, God rest her soul--the firmest possible belief and faith in God. And I don\\'t believe--I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not--I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others. And I do resort to prayer.\\n\\nAt the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign--or religion a part of that campaign. As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale\\'s running mate said I wasn\\'t a good Christian.\\n\\nSo, it does play a part in my life. I have no hesitancy in saying so. And, as I say, I don\\'t believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.\\n\\nMr. Barnes. Given those beliefs, Mr. President, why don\\'t you attend services regularly, either by going to church or by inviting a minister to the White House, as President Nixon used to do, or someone to Camp David, as President Carter used to do?\\n\\nThe President. The answer to your question is very simple about why I don\\'t go to church. I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington. And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut--we\\'re supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand--but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.\\n\\nI know the threats that are made against me. We all know the possibility of terrorism. We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House. And, therefore, I don\\'t feel--and my minister knows this and supports me in this position--I don\\'t feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example. And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands. [Applause]\\n\\nMs. Walters. May I ask you, please-- [applause] --may I ask the audience please to refrain from applause.\\n\\nFred, your second question.\\n\\nMr. Barnes. Mr. Mondale, would you describe your religious beliefs and mention whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how those beliefs would affect your decisions as President?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. First of all, I accept President Reagan\\'s affirmation of faith. I\\'m sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.\\n\\nI am a son of a Methodist minister. My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. And I don\\'t know if I\\'ve been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family. And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency. Whether that helps or not, I don\\'t know.\\n\\nI have a deep religious faith. Our family does. It is fundamental. It\\'s probably the reason that I\\'m in politics. I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead. And I think we\\'re all together on that.\\n\\nWhat bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one\\'s own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others\\' faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others. All history tells us that that\\'s a mistake.\\n\\nWhen the Republican platform says that from here on out, we\\'re going to have a religious test for judges before they\\'re selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that\\'s an abuse of faith in our country.\\n\\nThis nation is the most religious nation on Earth--more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth-and it\\'s because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith. That\\'s why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians. And I think if we want to continue--as I do--to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you. Mr. Barnes, next question. We have time for rebuttal now.\\n\\nMr. Barnes. I think I have a followup.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Yes, I asked you if you did. I\\'m sorry.--\\n\\nMr. Barnes. Yes, I do.\\n\\nMs. Walters. --I thought you waived it.\\n\\nMr. Barnes. Yes, Mr. Mondale, you\\'ve complained, just now, about Jerry Falwell, and you\\'ve complained other times about other fundamentalists in politics. Correct me if I\\'m wrong, but I don\\'t recall your ever complaining about ministers who are involved in the civil rights movement or in the anti-Vietnam war demonstrations or about black preachers who\\'ve been so involved in American politics. Is it only conservative ministers that you object to?\\n\\nMr. Mondale, No. What I object to-- [applause] --what I object to--what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.\\n\\nA minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire. The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in. It\\'s when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political--or private religious faith and the use of the state is where--for the most personal decisions in American life--that\\'s where I draw the line.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you. Now, Mr. President, rebuttal.\\n\\nThe President. Yes, it\\'s very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale. I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there. The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion. And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion. A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can\\'t do it because it\\'s school property. These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.\\n\\nWith regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that. I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O\\'Connor. I\\'ll stand on my record on that. And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I\\'ll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal, please.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges. And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges. And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.\\n\\nLet\\'s take the example that the President cites. I believe in prayer. My family prays. We\\'ve never had any difficulty finding time to pray. But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves? Who would write the prayer? What would it say? How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?\\n\\nIt seems to me that a moment\\'s reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it. We don\\'t want that.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you, Mr. Mondale. Our time is up for this round.\\n\\nWe go into the second round of our questioning, begin again with Jim Wieghart.\\n\\nJim?\\n\\nPolitical Issues\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. After that discussion, this may be like going from the sublime to the ridiculous, but here goes. I have a political question for you, Mr. Mondale. [Laughter]\\n\\nPolls indicate a massive change in the electorate, away from the coalition that has long made the Democratic Party a majority. Blue-collar workers, young professionals, their children, and much of the middle class now regard themselves as Independents or Republican instead of Democrats, and the gap--the edge the Democrats had in party registration seems to be narrowing.\\n\\nI\\'d like to ask you, Mr. Mondale, what is causing this? Is the Democratic Party out of sync with the majority of Americans? And will it soon be replaced as the majority party by the Republicans? What do you think needs to be done about it, as a Democrat?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. My answer is that this campaign isn\\'t over yet. And when people vote, I think you\\'re going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I\\'m talking about.\\n\\nThe American people want arms control. They don\\'t want this arms race. And they don\\'t want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens. And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.\\n\\nThe American people see this debt, and they know it\\'s got to come down. And if it won\\'t come down, the economy\\'s going to slow down, maybe go into a recession. They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history. And they know this debt must come down as well, because it\\'s unfair to our children.\\n\\nThe American people want this environment protected. They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people\\'s lives and health are being risked, because we\\'ve had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment.\\n\\nThe American people want their children educated. They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that\\'s widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.\\n\\nThe American people want to keep opening doors. They want those civil rights laws enforced. They want the equal rights amendment ratified. They want equal pay for comparable effort for women. And they want it because they\\'ve understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we\\'re all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.\\n\\nI think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. Mondale, isn\\'t it possible that the American people have heard your message--and they are listening--but they are rejecting it?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit. The President says it\\'ll disappear automatically. I\\'ve said it\\'s going to take some work. I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.\\n\\nSecondly, I\\'ve said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed. The President answers that it didn\\'t happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission. As the record develops, I think it\\'s going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. President, you and your party are benefiting from what appears to be an erosion of the old Democratic coalition, but you have not laid out a specific agenda to take this shift beyond November 6th. What is your program for America for the next decade, with some specificity?\\n\\nThe President. Well, again, I\\'m running on the record. I think sometimes Mr. Mondale\\'s running away from his. But I\\'m running on the record of what we have asked for. We\\'ll continue to try to get things that we didn\\'t get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government. And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago--I know, because I was a Democrat at that time. And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people.\\n\\nI promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation. We have, to onethird of what it was. I promised that we would reduce taxes. We did, 25 percent across the board. That barely held even with--if it did that much--with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977. But at least it took that burden away from them.\\n\\nI said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did--6 million in the last 20 or 21 months. I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons. We have done that.\\n\\nAll of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done. And I think this is something the American people see.\\n\\nI think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education--on excellence in education. And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems. We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth. All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.\\n\\nSo, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn\\'t taking us where we want to go.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. President, much of what you said affects the quality of life of many Americans--their income, the way they live, and so forth--but there\\'s an aspect to quality of life that lies beyond the private sector which has to do with our neighborhoods, our cities, our streets, our parks, our environment. In those areas, I have difficulty seeing what your program is and what you feel the Federal responsibility is in these areas of the quality of life in the public sector that affects everybody, and even enormous wealth by one individual can\\'t create the kind of environment that he might like.\\n\\nThe President. There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you\\'ve named some of them. Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down--or since we\\'ve kept records--2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we\\'ve had. I think that we\\'ve had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.\\n\\nThe environment? Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment. When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program--but it\\'s just about finished already--a billion dollars. And now we\\'re going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks. We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges. I think that we\\'re out in front of most--and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can\\'t continue. But I\\'ve got more.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Well, you\\'ll have a chance when your rebuttal time comes up, perhaps,\\n\\nMr. President. Mr. Mondale, now it\\'s your turn for rebuttal.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it. The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon. I was chairman of \"Minnesotans for Kennedy;\" President Reagan was chairman of a thing called \"Democrats for Nixon.\" Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I\\'ll be proud of supporting him all of my life. And I\\'m very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.\\n\\nThe President just said that his government is shrinking. It\\'s not. It\\'s now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy. And instead of retreating.--instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life. That\\'s where government should not be.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. President?\\n\\nThe President. Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States. And so, my change had come earlier than that. I hadn\\'t gotten around to reregistering as yet. I found that was rather difficult to do. But I finally did it.\\n\\nThere are some other things that have been said here--back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up. Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers\\' worst year. The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done. The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21 1/2-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier. All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers. As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of i percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you, Mr. President. We\\'ll now turn to Diane Sawyer for her round of questions.\\n\\nDiane?\\n\\nAbortion\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. I\\'d like to turn to an area that I think few people enjoy discussing, but that we probably should tonight because the positions of the two candidates are so clearly different and lead to very different policy consequences--and that is abortion and right to life. I\\'m exploring for your personal views of abortion and specifically how you would want them applied as public policy.\\n\\nFirst, Mr. President. Do you consider abortion murder or a sin? And second, how hard would you work--what kind of priority would you give in your second term legislation to make abortion illegal? And specifically, would you make certain, as your party platform urges, that Federal justices that you appoint be pro-life?\\n\\nThe President. I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life. Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life. But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is-there\\'s been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government. With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it\\'s a problem of the Constitution.\\n\\nI believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us. And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying--I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious--there were clerics there-everyone talking about this matter of pro-life. And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive. We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.\\n\\nAlso, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life. In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor--signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder. Now, isn\\'t it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that\\'s murder? And it used the term \"death of the unborn child.\"\\n\\nSo, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine--and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. A two-part followup. Do I take it from what you\\'ve said about the platform, then, that you don\\'t regard the language and don\\'t regard in your own appointments, abortion position a test of any kind for justices--that it should be? And also, if abortion is made illegal, how would you want it enforced? Who would be the policing units that would investigate? And would you want the women who have abortions to be prosecuted?\\n\\nThe President. The laws regarding that always were State laws. It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy. Our laws against murder are State laws. So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.\\n\\nAs I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve. And no one has approached it from that matter. It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma. I know that some churches do.\\n\\nNow, it is a sin if you\\'re taking a human life. At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense. And therefore, I\\'ve always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. Mr. Mondale, to turn to you, do you consider abortion a murder or a sin? And bridging from what President Reagan said, he has written that if society doesn\\'t know whether life does--human life, in fact, does begin at conception, as long as there is a doubt, that the unborn child should at least be given the benefit of the doubt and that there should be protection for that unborn child.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated. I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.\\n\\nThe constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest. Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your living rooms and making choices like this? I think it cannot work, won\\'t work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law. Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them. The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.\\n\\nI think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different. Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step. But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.\\n\\nNow, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion. Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her. That\\'s always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime. But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped? Do we really want those decisions made by judges who\\'ve been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty? I don\\'t think so, and I think it\\'s going in exactly the wrong direction.\\n\\nIn America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives. We haven\\'t felt so insecure that we\\'ve reached for the club of state to have our point of view. It\\'s been a good instinct. And we\\'re the most religious people on Earth.\\n\\nOne final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal pro-abortion bill of any State in the Union.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. But if I can get you back for a moment on my point, which was the question of when human life begins--a two-part followup. First of all, at what point do you believe that human life begins in the growth of a fetus? And second of all, you said that government shouldn\\'t be involved in the decisions. Yet there are those who would say that government is involved, and the consequence of the involvement was 1.5 million abortions in 1980. And how do you feel about that?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and that\\'s the way it\\'s been done. And it\\'s a personal and private, moral judgment. I don\\'t know the answer to when life begins. And it\\'s not that simple, either. You\\'ve got another life involved. And if it\\'s rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that? If it\\'s incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that? Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment? It won\\'t work. [Applause]\\n\\nMs. Walters. I\\'m sorry to do this, but I really must talk to the audience.\\n\\nYou\\'re all invited guests. I know I\\'m wasting time in talking to you, but it really is very unfair of you to applaud--sometimes louder, less loud--and I ask you, as people who were invited here, and polite people, to refrain.\\n\\nWe have our time now for rebuttal. Mr. President.\\n\\nThe President. Yes. Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn\\'t that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not capable, and I don\\'t think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life. I am simply saying that I believe that that\\'s where the effort should be directed--to make that determination.\\n\\nI don\\'t think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition. That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we\\'re talking about a life. But in this great society of ours, wouldn\\'t it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption? There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can\\'t have them any other way.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. Mondale.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. I agree with that, and that\\'s why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative. I\\'m all for that. But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued. And I don\\'t agree with it.\\n\\nSince I\\'ve got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing. The question of agriculture came up a minute ago. Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it. And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent. It\\'s been a big failure. I opposed the grain embargo in my administration. I\\'m opposed to these policies as well.\\n\\nMs. Walters. I\\'m sitting here like the great schoolteacher, letting you both get away with things--because one did it, the other one did it. May I ask in the future that the rebuttal stick to what the rebuttal is. And also, foreign policy will be the next debate. Stop dragging it in by its ear into this one. [Laughter]\\n\\nNow, having admonished you, I would like to say to the panel, you are allowed one question and one followup. Would you try, as best you could, not to ask two and three--I know it\\'s something we all want to do--two and three questions as part one and two and three as part two.\\n\\nHaving said that, Fred, it\\'s yours.\\n\\nFederal Taxation\\n\\nMr. Barnes. Thank you. Mr. Mondale, let me ask you about middle-class Americans and the taxes they pay. Now, I\\'m talking not about the rich or the poor--I know your views on their taxes--but about families earning 25,000 to 45,000 a year. Do you think that those families are overtaxed or undertaxed by the Federal Government?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn\\'t get any relief the first time around.\\n\\nUnder the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up. That\\'s why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a fiat tax.\\n\\nWhat does this mean in real life? Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people. He\\'s one of the wealthiest Americans, and he\\'s our Vice President. In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes. In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes. That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.\\n\\nI believe we need some fairness. And that\\'s why I\\'ve proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who\\'ve already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.\\n\\nMr. Barnes. It sounds as if you are saying you think this group of taxpayers making 25,000 to 45,000 a year is already overtaxed, yet your tax proposal would increase their taxes. I think your aides have said those earning about 25,000 to 35,000, their tax rate would go up--their tax bill would go up a hundred dollars, and from 35,000 to 45,000, more than that, several hundred dollars. Wouldn\\'t that stifle their incentive to work and invest and so on, and also hurt the recovery?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. The first thing is, everybody 25,000 and under would have no tax increase.\\n\\nMr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes. And his Secretary of the Treasury said he\\'s studying a sales tax or a value-added tax. They\\'re the same thing. They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.\\n\\nUp until about $70,000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial. As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I\\'d like to see the total repeal of indexing. I don\\'t think we can do that for a few years. But at some point, we want to do that as well.\\n\\nMr. Barnes. Mr. President, let me try this on you. Do you think middle-income Americans are overtaxed or undertaxed?\\n\\nThe President. You know, I wasn\\'t going to say this at all, but I can\\'t help it. There you go again. [Laughter] I don\\'t have a plan to tax--or increase taxes. I\\'m not going to increase taxes. I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.\\n\\nNow, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it\\'s that government is overfed. And I think that most of our people--this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up. And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down. From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.\\n\\nNow, the Social Security tax of \\'77--this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest. It had two features. It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time--there are two more yet to come between now and 1989. At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money--virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there--that was subject to that tax. Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security. And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20--they\\'re paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.\\n\\nNow, I don\\'t think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn\\'t work out that way. The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I\\'ve said, and that has not been changed. But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person. Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also. But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.\\n\\nMr. Barnes. I thought I caught, Mr. President, a glimmer of a stronger statement there in your answer than you\\'ve made before. I think the operative position you had before was that you would only raise taxes in a second term as a last resort, and I thought you said flatly that \"I\\'m not going to raise taxes.\" Is that what you meant to say, that you will not--that you will flatly not raise taxes in your second term as President\\'?\\n\\nThe President. Yes, I had used--\"last resort\" would always be with me. If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted.\\n\\nI don\\'t foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I\\'m not going to go for a tax.\\n\\nWith regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there--had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust. All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. Mondale, here we go again. It\\'s time for rebuttal.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal. I\\'m just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that\\'s what\\'s happening all over this country with wealthy Americans. They\\'ve got so many loopholes they don\\'t have to pay much in taxes.\\n\\nNow, Mr. President, you said, \"There you go again,\" right?\\n\\nThe President. Yes.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. You remember the last time you said that?\\n\\nThe President. Mm-hmm.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare, and you said, \"Oh, no, there you go again, Mr. President.\" And what did you do right after the election? You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare. And so, when you say, \"There you go again\"--people remember this, you know. [Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do? You\\'ve got a $260 billion deficit. You can\\'t wish it away. You won\\'t slow defense spending; you refuse to do that--\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. Mondale, I\\'m afraid your time is up.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Sorry.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Mr. President?\\n\\nThe President. Yes. With regard to Medicare, no, but it\\'s time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound. And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem. And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.\\n\\nMs. Walters. All right. Fine.\\n\\nThe President. I gave you back some of that time. [Laughter]\\n\\nMs. Walters. We can\\'t keep going back for other rebuttals; there\\'ll be time later.\\n\\nWe now go to our final round. The way things stand now, we have time for only two sets of questions, and by lot, it will be Jim and Diane. And we\\'ll start with Jim Wieghart.\\n\\nSocial Welfare Programs\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. President, the economic recovery is real, but uneven. The Census Bureau, just a month ago, reported that there are more people living under poverty now, a million more people living under it, than when you took office.\\n\\nThere have been a number of studies, including studies by the Urban Institute and other nonpolitical organizations, that say that the impact of the tax and budget cuts and your economic policies have impacted severely on certain classes of Americans-working mothers, head of households, minority groups, elderly poor. In fact, they\\'re saying the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer under your policies.\\n\\nWhat relief can you offer to the working poor, to the minorities, and to the women head of households who have borne the brunt of these economic programs? What can you offer them in the future, in your next term?\\n\\nThe President. Well, some of those facts and figures just don\\'t stand up. Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here. It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.\\n\\nOn the other hand, women heads of household--single women heads of household have--for the first time there\\'s been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them. We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings. It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs.\\n\\nWe are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980. We\\'re spending a third more on all of the-well, all of the programs of human service. We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before--2,300,000 more are receiving them--even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them. We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits. We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.\\n\\nSome time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind. Half--one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid. But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans. We didn\\'t think that was right. And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low.\\n\\nSo, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have. 7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings--7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. President, in a visit to Texas--in Brownsville, I believe it was, in the Rio Grande Valley--you did observe that the economic recovery was uneven.\\n\\nThe President. Yes.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. In that particular area of Texas, unemployment was over 14 percent, whereas statewide, it was the lowest in the country, I believe--5.6 percent. And you made the comment, however, that man does not live by bread alone. What did you mean by that comment? And if I interpret it correctly, it would be a comment more addressed to the affluent who obviously can look beyond just the bread they need to sustain them, with their wherewithal.\\n\\nThe President. That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything. I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject. I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we\\'re finding all over America. And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people. So, that was the only place that that was used.\\n\\nI did avoid, I\\'m afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes. There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didn\\'t even feel the pain of the recession.\\n\\nWe\\'re not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. Mondale, as you can gather from the question to the President, the celebrated War on Poverty obviously didn\\'t end the problem of poverty, although it may have dented it. The poor and the homeless and the disadvantaged are still with us. What should the Federal Government\\'s role be to turn back the growth in the number of people living below the poverty level, which is now 35 million in the United States, and to help deal with the structural unemployment problems that the President was referring to in an uneven recovery?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Number one, we\\'ve got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.\\n\\nNumber two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities--through the Urban Development Action Grant Program. I don\\'t mind those enterprise zones; let\\'s try them, but not as a substitute for the others. Certainly education and training is crucial. If these young Americans don\\'t have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they\\'re not going to get jobs.\\n\\nThe next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they\\'re found. The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.\\n\\nThere is no question that the poor are worse off. I think the President genuinely believes that they\\'re better off. But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago. How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them for example, the disabled, who have no alternative--how they\\'re going to do better, I don\\'t know. Now, we need a tight budget, but there\\'s no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they\\'re hurting.\\n\\nOne final point if I might. There\\'s another part of the lopsided economy that we\\'re in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports. We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year. That\\'s another reason to get the deficit down.\\n\\nMr. Wieghart. Mr. Mondale, is it possible that the vast majority of Americans who appear to be prosperous have lost interest in the kinds of programs you\\'re discussing to help those less privileged than they are?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent. I think they stand for civil rights. I know they\\'re all for education in science and training, which I strongly support. They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest. I think the business community wants to get involved. I think they\\'re asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved. I think that\\'s part of it. I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they\\'re not having to take money that\\'s desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else. I\\'m opposed to that, too.\\n\\nMs. Walters. And now it is time for our rebuttal for this period. Mr. President?\\n\\nThe President. Yes. The connection that\\'s been made again between the deficit and the interest rates--there is no connection between them. There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited--that the interest rates came down from 21 1/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure. And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase. They were going up. Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down.\\n\\nThe interest rates are based on inflation. And right now I have to tell you I don\\'t think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low. I think it can only be that they\\'re anticipating or hope--expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don\\'t have a control of inflation and it\\'s going to go back up again. Well, it isn\\'t going to go back up. We\\'re going to see that it doesn\\'t.\\n\\nAnd I haven\\'t got time to answer with regard to the disabled.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nMr. Mondale.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don\\'t have anything to do with interest rates. I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why--energy prices and so on. There\\'s no way of glossing around that. But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what\\'s called the real interest rates--the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled--and that\\'s still the case today. And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and it\\'s attributable to the deficit.\\n\\nEverybody--every economist, every businessman-believes that. Your own Council of Economic Advisers--Mr. Feldstein in his report told you that. Every chairman of the Finance and Ways and Means Committee, Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are telling you that. That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy. It\\'s causing high interest rates. It\\'s ruining us in trade. It\\'s given us the highest small business failure in 50 years. The economy is starting downhill with housing failure.-\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you, Mr. Mondale.\\n\\nYou\\'re both very obedient. I have to give you credit for that.\\n\\nWe now start our final round of questions. We do want to have time for your rebuttal.\\n\\nWe start with Diane--Diane Sawyer.\\n\\nPresidential Campaign\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. Since we are reaching the end of the question period, and since in every Presidential campaign, the candidates tend to complain that the opposition candidate is not held accountable for what he or she says, let me give you the chance to do that.\\n\\nMr. Mondale, beginning with you. What do you think the most outrageous thing is your opponent said in this debate tonight? [Laughter]\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Do you want to give me some suggestions? [Laughter] I\\'m going to use my time a little differently. I\\'m going to give the President some credit. I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he\\'s entitled to credit for that. What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America\\'s problems.\\n\\nI think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn\\'t like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit. But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.\\n\\nI like President Reagan. And this is not personal--there are deep differences about our future, and that\\'s the basis of my campaign.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. Follow up in a similar vein, then. What remaining question would you most like to see your opponent forced to answer?\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down. And I\\'ve done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I\\'d do.\\n\\nMr. Reagan, as you saw tonight--President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic. It was once called voodoo economics. I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right. Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit. This is how I\\'m going to get it done. Don\\'t talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that\\'s not helping. It\\'s going to go in the other direction, as they\\'ve estimated.\\n\\nAnd give us a plan. What will you cut? Whose taxes will you raise? Will you finally touch that defense budget? Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time? If you\\'d just tell us what you\\'re going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan. And that\\'s the way it should be. The American people would be in charge.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. Mr. President, the most outrageous thing your opponent has said in the debate tonight?\\n\\nThe President. Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.\\n\\nI\\'ll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in \\'82. And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them.\\n\\nAnd why I think it is outrageous--first of all, it isn\\'t true. But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn. And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, \"Is this true? Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute?\" And I don\\'t think that that should be a part of political dialog.\\n\\nNow, to--I still--I just have a minute here?\\n\\nMs. Walters. You have more time.\\n\\nThe President. Oh, I--\\n\\nMs. Walters. You can keep going.\\n\\nThe President. Okay. All right.\\n\\nNow, Social Security, let\\'s lay it to rest once and for all. I told you never would I do such a thing. But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit. Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee. If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit. It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund. So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.\\n\\nNow, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn\\'t work. And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation. And none of these things happened. It is working, and we\\'re going to continue on that same line.\\n\\nAs to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we\\'re not going to starve the hungry. But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we\\'re studying right now--and we\\'ve already implemented 17 percent of them-that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.\\n\\nMs. Sawyer. And to keep it even, what remaining question would you most like to see your opponent forced to answer?\\n\\nThe President. Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment. In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits-there was nothing wrong with having deficits.\\n\\nRemember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here. That\\'s got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don\\'t do it. And I\\'m hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here. That\\'s why I want another 4 years.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Well, we have time now, if you\\'d like to answer the President\\'s question, or whatever rebuttal.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. Well, we\\'ve just finished almost the whole debate. And the American people don\\'t have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits. [Laughter] And yet, that\\'s the most important single issue of our time.\\n\\nI did support the \\'76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation. But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President. In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year. This administration seems to run that every morning. And the result is exactly what we see. This economy is starting to run downhill. Housing is off. Last report on new purchases, it\\'s the lowest since 1982. Growth is a little over 3 percent now. Many people are predicting a recession. And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.\\n\\nWe\\'ve got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we\\'re going to do, so you can make a judgment.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you very much. We must stop now. I want to give you time for your closing statements. It\\'s indeed time for that from each of you. We will begin with President Reagan.\\n\\nOh, I\\'m sorry, Mr. Reagan, you had your rebuttal, and I just cut you off because our time is going. You have a chance now for rebuttal before your closing statement. Is that correct?\\n\\nThe President. No, I might as well just go with-\\n\\nMs. Walters. Do you want to go with your--\\n\\nThe President. I don\\'t think so. I\\'m all confused now.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Technically, you did. I have little voices that come in my ear. [Laughter] You don\\'t get those same voices. I\\'m not hearing it from here--I\\'m hearing it from here.\\n\\nThe President. All right.\\n\\nMs. Walters. You have waived your rebuttal. You can go with your closing statement.\\n\\nClosing Statements\\n\\nThe President. Well, we\\'ll include it in that.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Okay.\\n\\nThe President. Four years ago, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the American people, a question. I asked: \"Are you better off than you were 4 years before?\" The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.\\n\\nNow, maybe I\\'m expected to ask that same question again. I\\'m not going to, because I think that all of you--or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven\\'t caught up, they couldn\\'t answer the way I would want them to--but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago.\\n\\nThe question, I think, should be enlarged. Is America better off than it was 4 years ago? And I believe the answer to that has to also be \"yes.\" I promised a new beginning. So far, it is only a beginning. If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job.\\n\\nBut we now have an economy that, for the first time--well, let\\'s put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent. The first half of \\'84 it\\'s up 8 1/2 percent. Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent. Today it is up a plus 4 percent.\\n\\nPersonal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years. In 1980--or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty. By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.\\n\\nWe have restored much of our economy. With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949. So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital. We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below. We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure.\\n\\nYes, we have an increase in the defense budget. But back then we had planes that couldn\\'t fly for lack of spare parts or pilots. We had navy vessels that couldn\\'t leave harbor because of lack of crew or, again, lack of spare parts. Today we\\'re well on our way to a 600-ship navy. We have 543 at present.\\n\\nWe have--our military, the morale is high. I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension. And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons. But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons. There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500. Well, we are the ones who found those.\\n\\nI think we\\'ve given the American people back their spirit. I think there\\'s an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we\\'re in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: \"We have it in our power to begin the world over again.\"\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you, Mr. Reagan.\\n\\nMr. Mondale, the closing words are now yours.\\n\\nMr. Mondale. I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening\\'s debate. I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. He didn\\'t have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it.\\n\\nThe President\\'s favorite question is: Are you better off?. Well, if you\\'re wealthy, you\\'re better off. If you\\'re middle income, you\\'re about where you were. And if you\\'re modest income, you\\'re worse off. That\\'s what the economists tell us.\\n\\nBut is that really the question that should be asked? Isn\\'t the real question is will we be better off?. Will our children be better off?. Are we building the future that this nation needs? I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you\\'ll see that we need new leadership.\\n\\nAre we better of with this arms race? Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens? Are we better off when we de-emphasize our values in human rights? Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt? Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now--over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children? Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?\\n\\nI would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest. I don\\'t think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited. When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability-confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don\\'t think that\\'s what America is all about.\\n\\nAmerica is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him. I believe there\\'s fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.\\n\\nI believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment. And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful. These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price. That\\'s not fair for our future.\\n\\nI think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we\\'re being pressed harder all the time.\\n\\nI believe in opening doors. We won the Olympics, in part, because we\\'ve had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women. I have been for those efforts all my life. The President\\'s record is quite different.\\n\\nThe question is our future. President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, \"We are great, but we can be greater.\" We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nMs. Walters. Thank you, Mr. Mondale. [Applause] Please, we have not finished quite yet.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. Mondale, and thank you, Mr. President. And our thanks to our panel members, as well.\\n\\nAnd so we bring to a close this first of the League of Women Voters Presidential debates of 1984. You two can go at each again in the final League debate on October 21st, in Kansas City, Missouri. And this Thursday night, October 11th, at 9 p.m. eastern daylight time, the Vice President, George Bush, will debate Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro in Philadelphia.\\n\\nAnd I hope that you will all watch once again. No matter what the format is, these debates are very important. We all have an extremely vital decision to make.\\n\\nOnce more, gentlemen, our thanks. Once more, to you, our thanks.\\n\\nNow, this is Barbara Walters wishing you a good evening.'}, {'file': '96_debate_1', 'content': 'Jim Lehrer. Good evening from the Shiley Theatre at the University of San Diego, San Diego, California. I\\'m Jim Lehrer of the \"NewsHour\" on PBS. Welcome to this second 1996 Presidential debate between Senator Bob Dole, the Republican nominee, and President Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee. It is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\\n\\nWe will follow a townhall-type format tonight. The questions over the next 90 minutes will come from 113 citizens of the greater San Diego area. They were chosen in the past week by the Gallup organization to represent a rough cross-section of voters as to political views, age, gender, and other factors. Each said he or she is undecided about this Presidential race.\\n\\nThey were told to come tonight with questions. Nobody from the Debate Commission or the two campaigns has any idea what those questions are; neither do I. We will all be hearing them for the first time at the same time. I met with this group 3 hours ago, and we spoke only about how it was going to work tonight. They are sitting in five sections. I will call on individuals at random, moving from one section to another with each new question, alternating the questions between the two candidates. My job is to keep things fair and the subjects as clear and as varied as possible.\\n\\nThe rules, drawn by the campaigns, are basically the same as they were for the Hartford and St. Petersburg debates: 90-second answers, 60-second rebuttals, 30-second responses for each question. The candidates are not allowed to question each other directly. There will be 2-minute opening and closing statements. The order for this evening was set by coin toss.\\n\\nWe begin now with Senator Dole and his opening statement.\\n\\nSenator Dole.\\n\\nOpening Statements\\n\\nSenator Bob Dole. Thank you very much, Jim.\\n\\nLet me first give you a sports update: the Braves, one; Cardinals, nothing‚Äîearly on.\\n\\nI want to thank you and I want to thank everybody here tonight, and I want a special thanks to my wife, Elizabeth, and my daughter, Robin, for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America.\\n\\nIn 20 days, you will help decide who will lead this country into the next century. It\\'s an awesome responsibility. And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates? You should know as much as possible about each of us. Sometimes the views have been distorted‚Äîand millions and millions of dollars in negative advertising spent distorting my views‚Äî but I hope tonight you\\'ll get a better feel of who Bob Dole is and what he\\'s all about.\\n\\nAnd I think first you should‚ÄîI should understand that the question on your mind is, do I understand your problem? But I understand it if‚Äîit occurred to me and I might just say that I\\'m from a large family. I\\'ve got lots of relatives, and they\\'re good, average, middle class, hard-working Americans. They live all across the country. They\\'re not all Republicans‚Äîmaybe all but one. [Laughter]\\n\\nBut in any event, I understand the problems, whether it\\'s two parents working because one has to pay the taxes and one has to provide for the family; whether it\\'s a single parent who just barely pays the pressing bills; or whether you\\'re worried about an education for your children‚Äîare they going to the best schools; or whether you\\'re worried about safe playgrounds, drug-free schools, crime-free schools.\\n\\nThis is what this election is all about. And hopefully tonight when we conclude this debate, you will have a better understanding and the viewing and listening audience will have a better understanding. Thank you. [Applause]\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Mr. President, 2 minutes, opening statement.\\n\\nThe President. I was going to applaud, too. [Laughter]\\n\\nWell, thank you, Jim, and thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision. Again I will say, I\\'ll do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults. What really matters is what happens to your future and what happens to our country as we stand on the brink of a new century, a time of extraordinary possibility.\\n\\nI have a simple philosophy that I\\'ve tried to follow for the last 4 years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybody\\'s got a role to play and a place at the table.\\n\\nCompared to 4 years ago, we\\'re clearly better off. We\\'ve got 10 1/2 million more jobs; the deficit\\'s been reduced by 60 percent; incomes are rising for the first time in a decade; the crime rates, the welfare rolls are falling; we\\'re putting 100,000 more police on the street; 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers have been denied handguns.\\n\\nBut that progress is only the beginning. What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that\\'s out there. I think what really matters is what we can do to help build strong families. Strong families need a strong economy. To me, that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment.\\n\\nWe should give a tax cut targeted to childrearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care. We ought to help protect our kids from drugs and guns and gangs and tobacco. We ought to help move a million people from welfare to work. And we ought to create the finest education system in the world, where every 18-year-old can go on to college and all of our younger children have great educational opportunities. If we do those things, we can build that bridge to the 21st century. That\\'s what I hope to get to talk about tonight.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right, let\\'s go now to the first question from this section, and it\\'s for Senator Dole.\\n\\nYes, ma\\'am? Yes?\\n\\nQ. Hello, Senator Dole.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Hi.\\n\\nLeadership To Promote Unity\\n\\nQ. My name is Shannon MacAfee. I\\'m a beginning educator in this country, and I really think it\\'s important what children have to say. They\\'re still very idealistic, and everything they say comes from the heart. I have a quote for you from \"If I Were President,\" compiled by Peggy Gavin. A sixth grader says, \"If I were President, I would think about Abraham Lincoln and George Washington and what they did to make our country great. We should unite the white and black people and people of all cultures. Democrats and Republicans should unite also. We should all come together and think of the best ways to solve the economic problems of our country. I believe that when we are able to come together and stop fighting amongst ourselves, we will get along a lot better.\"\\n\\nThese are the ideals and morals that we are trying to teach our children in these days, yet we don\\'t seem to be practicing them in our Government, in anything. If you are President, how will you begin to practice what we are preaching to our children, the future of our Nation?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, I would say, first of all, I think it\\'s a very good question, and I appreciate the quote from the young man.\\n\\nThere\\'s no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government. They see scandals almost on a daily basis. They see ethical problems in the White House today. They see 900 FBI files of private persons being gathered up by somebody in the White House; nobody knows who hired this man. So there\\'s a great deal of cynicism out there.\\n\\nBut I\\'ve always tried, in whatever I\\'ve done, to bring people together. I said in my acceptance speech in San Diego about 2 months ago that the exits are clearly marked. If you think the Republican Party is someplace for you to come if you\\'re narrow-minded or bigoted or don\\'t like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of, as I stand here without compromise because this is the party of Lincoln.\\n\\nI think we have a real obligation, obviously, public officials. I\\'m no longer a public official; I left public life on June 11th of this year. But it is very important. Young people are looking to us. They\\'re looking to us for leadership.\\n\\nThey\\'re watching what we do, what we say, what we promise, and what we finally deliver. And I would think‚Äîit seems to me that there are opportunities here. When I\\'m President of the United States, I will keep my word. My word is my bond.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Mr. President?\\n\\nThe President. One of the reasons that I ran for President, Sandy, is because not just children, a lot of grownups felt that way. If you remember, 4 years ago we had not only rising unemployment but a lot of rising cynicism. I\\'d never worked in Washington as an elected official. It seemed to me that most of the arguments were partisan: Republican, Democrat; left, right; liberal, conservative. That\\'s why I said tonight I\\'m for opportunity, responsibility, and community. And we\\'ve gotten some real progress in the last 4 years. I\\'ve also done everything I could at every moment of division in this country‚Äîafter Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned‚Äîto bring people together and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity. We have to respect one another.\\n\\nYou mentioned Washington and Lincoln; they were Presidents at historic times. This is an historic time. It\\'s important that we go beyond those old partisan arguments and focus on people and their future. When we do that, instead of shutting the Government down over a partisan fight on the budget, we\\'re a better country, and that\\'s why we\\'re making progress now.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, bringing people together again is obviously a responsibility we all have. I know you do it. Everybody here does it. You do a lot of things nobody knows about. I have a little foundation for the disabled called the Dole Foundation. We\\'ve raised about $10 million. We don\\'t talk about it. We try to help people with disabilities. We bring them back into the mainstream of public life.\\n\\nSo it seems to me that there\\'s also a public trust. When you\\'re the President of the United States, you have a public trust, and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington did and as Abraham Lincoln did. And I think now that trust is being violated. And it seems to me we ought to face up to it, and the President ought to say tonight that he\\'s not going to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who might implicate him later on.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right, the next question from this section right here. Right there in the middle, sir. Yes, sir?\\n\\nHealth Care\\n\\nQ. Dr. Robert Berkeley; I\\'m a cardiologist from Fallbrook, California. Mr. President, I\\'d like to know if you\\'d please explain your plans for‚Äîin a substantive fashion, for addressing the problems with the health care system in our country.\\n\\nThe President. I will. First of all, let me say what we have done: In the last 4 years, we\\'ve worked hard to promote more competition to bring down the rate of inflation in health care costs without eroding health care quality. The Government pays for Medicare and Medicaid, as you know, and that\\'s very important.\\n\\nSecondly, we\\'ve added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program. We have protected 25 million people through the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you can\\'t lose your health insurance if you change jobs or if someone in your family\\'s been sick. We just recently ended those drive-by deliveries, saying people couldn\\'t be kicked out of the hospital by insurance companies when they\\'d just had babies. So this is‚Äîthat\\'s a good start.\\n\\nIn the next 4 years, I want to focus on the following things: Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program; number two, keep working with the States, as we are now, to add 2.2 million more people to the insurance system; number three, cover people who are between jobs for up to 6 months‚Äîthat could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids; and number four, make sure we protect the integrity of the Medicare program and the Medicaid program and not do anything in cutting costs which would cause hundreds of hospitals to close, as could have been the case if the $270 billion Medicare cut that I vetoed had been enacted into law.\\n\\nSenator Dole. First, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut. Now, I\\'ve heard you say this time after time, and I\\'ve heard you say on one TV appearance, \"The media made me do it.\" You were trying to defend your cut, which was not a cut either‚Äîa reduction in the growth of spending. And we always had at least 7 percent. You\\'ve said publicly that it\\'s now 3 times the rate of inflation, we ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation. That\\'s about where we are now. So let\\'s stop talking about cutting Medicare. In my economic plan we increase it 39 percent.\\n\\nDon\\'t forget what he tried to do with health care: 17 new taxes, spend $1.5 trillion, 50 new bureaucracies. Can you believe that? You couldn\\'t even have been a cardiologist because they had quotas. You had‚Äîyou couldn\\'t‚Äîyou\\'re a cardiologist; it wouldn\\'t affect you. But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist 10 years from now, you\\'d have to be certain that you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the Government was going to take over for all Americans. There are things we can do like the Kassebaum bill, that retains many provisions I authored, to cover preexisting‚Äîexisting‚Äîportability. And there are other things we can do. We still need to cover about 20 million people and a lot of children.\\n\\nThe President. I don\\'t have time in 30 seconds to respond to fix all that. But let me just say, the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals, not me. And on a per-person basis, it did cut way below the rate of inflation in medical costs.\\n\\nBut the important thing is, what are we going to do now? We need to help people who are between jobs. We need to cover more kids. We need to provide more preventive care. My balanced budget covers mammograms for ladies on‚Äîwomen on Medicare and also gives respite care to the million-plus families who have someone with Alzheimer\\'s. These things are paid for in the balanced budget plan. It will move us forward.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. The next question is for Senator Dole from here. Yes, sir?\\n\\nArmed Forces\\n\\nQ. Senator Dole, my name is Jason Milligan, active-duty military and a small-business owner. And my question is, what is your position on closing the gap between military and civilian pay scales?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a former military man myself.\\n\\nYou know, we have 17,000 men and women today wearing our uniform that receive food stamps. It shouldn\\'t happen in America. We have men and women wearing our uniform in substandard housing. It shouldn\\'t happen in America. And it\\'s time we take a look at the pay scales. You did get a 3 percent increase this year, but that\\'s not enough.\\n\\nIf we\\'re going to ask young men and young women to protect us and defend us around the world, and we\\'ve had more deployments under this administration than any time in history‚Äî 50 times we deployed troops around the world. Every time you do that, you take a risk‚Äîsomebody you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else. But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American. Remember Vietnam, remember when people almost used to walk across the street rather than have contact with somebody who was in Vietnam‚Äîthat\\'s all behind us now, and it should be behind us‚Äîand the forgotten war, the Korean war. But I guess, I can just answer you very plainly, Jason: Thank you for doing what you\\'re doing. America owes you a debt of gratitude.\\n\\nThe President. May I ask you a question? What kind of‚Äîwhich service are you in?\\n\\nQ. I\\'m in the United States Navy, sir.\\n\\nThe President. And what kind of small business do you have?\\n\\nQ. I have an Amway business.\\n\\nThe President. Good for you. Well, let me say‚ÄîSenator Dole mentioned this. I just signed a bill that we got through Congress to increase the amount of pay increase we could give for military personnel and to make sure the pay increase this year was above the rate of inflation. I also had presented to the Congress, and they adopted, a large package of quality-of-life improvements which are very important. I\\'ve spent a lot of time talking to military families, as well as military members, all over the world and in bases all across the United States. And I became convinced, after talking to the families and the personnel in uniform, that we needed to not only have the pay raise but we needed to invest more in child care, housing, and other things to support families, especially when there are longer deployments because of the downsizing of the military.\\n\\nSo we\\'re going to do better, and we\\'ll do better still. But this is a commitment I think that all Americans share, without regard to party.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator Dole?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, Jason, I don\\'t disagree with anything the President said except he waited 4 years to do these things. And my view is it ought to be‚Äîit\\'ll be done on day one.\\n\\nWe\\'ll start working on it on day one in the Dole-Kemp administration. This is important. Now, we only have 10 divisions now; we used to have 18. We had 25 fighter wings; we\\'re down to 13. We had 536 ships; we\\'re down to 336 ships. I mean, we\\'ve cut defense spending too much in the first place. The President told you in \\'92 he would cut it $67 billion; he cut $112 billion. So we\\'re right on the edge right now. But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniform sacrifice.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Next question here for President Clinton. Yes, ma\\'am, here on the front row.\\n\\nMiddle East Peace Process\\n\\nQ. President Clinton, my name is Cecily Kelly. Yesterday Yasser Arafat said in Palestine that he thinks the key to success in the Middle East is the commitment of Americans. Would you, as President, send American troops to Israel or the West Bank as peacekeepers?\\n\\nThe President. Let me just take 2 seconds of my time, because I\\'m the Commander in Chief, to respond to one thing that was said. I propose to spend $1.6 trillion on defense between now and the year 2002. And there\\'s less than one percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense.\\n\\nNow, on the Middle East, as you know, I\\'ve worked very hard for peace in the Middle East. The agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was signed at the White House. And the agreement, the peace treaty with Jordan, I went to Jordan to sign that, to be there. But‚Äî and I think the United States could do whatever we reasonably can.\\n\\nI can say this: I do not believe Yasser Arafat wants us to send troops to the West Bank. We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank.\\n\\nI saw the agreement that Prime Minister Rabin and Yasser Arafat signed on the West Bank. It had 26 separate maps they had to sign, literally thousands of delineations of who would do what on the West Bank. And I believe if the parties will get together and in a good faith manner make that agreement, that they\\'ll be able to do it. We cannot impose a peace on the Middle East.\\n\\nMy position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace. You know, if they ask me to be part of some monitoring force‚Äîas we are in the Sinai and have been since 1978 to monitor the peace between Egypt and Israel‚Äîfrankly, I would have to think about it; I would have to see what they wanted to do. But I don\\'t believe that will be the request. I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they\\'ve already made. That\\'s why I brought the leaders to Washington a few days ago. I think they will, and I think we\\'ll get there. Don\\'t be too discouraged.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, let me, Jason, come back to you a minute because there is a big difference in the defense budget. We had $7 billion this year, and $10 billion more than the President. He puts his money in the out years‚Äî even if he were reelected, you know, he\\'d be gone before anything happened. And nothing\\'s going to happen, because we don\\'t have modernization now. If we don\\'t build more B-2 bombers in California‚Äîand we lost about 500,000 jobs out in California because of this devastation, these big, big cuts. We had to make cuts; we didn\\'t have to make the cuts the President promised he\\'d make and then he doubled. And so I think we need to go back and take a look. We\\'re increasing defense reasonably, not too much but we are increasing defense some, because we want to be prepared in case somebody here gets called up, Jason.\\n\\nI would say I didn\\'t hear what Yasser Arafat had to say, but I don\\'t want to‚Äîyou know, I think foreign policy is something we want to be very careful about. And I\\'m not here to argue about the President on some ongoing foreign policy matter. What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it in his last statement, is call for an unconditional end to the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution. The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere.\\n\\nBut let\\'s sort of keep this out of politics, because it\\'s pretty dicey right now.\\n\\nThe President. When the change of government occurred in Israel, the people of Israel were saying, \"We don\\'t want to abandon the peace process. We want more security.\" Then, a lot of mutual distrust developed. A lot of things happened which maybe shouldn\\'t have happened.\\n\\nWhen I asked Yasser Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for 3 hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace. Again, I\\'d say if they ask us to play some reasonable role, I don\\'t know how I would respond. It would depend entirely on what they ask us to do. But the real secret there is for them to abide by the agreements they\\'ve made and find a way to trust each other. And they\\'re going to have to spend some time and trust each other.\\n\\nPrime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right, next question from this section, and it is for Senator Dole. Back in the back. Yes, sir, right there. Yes, sir.\\n\\nTobacco\\n\\nQ. Senator Dole, Oscar Delgado.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Oscar.\\n\\nQ. Ex-smoker for 30 years. About 30 years ago I was a pack-plus-a-day man, okay? You mentioned in a statement, you said some time ago that you didn\\'t think nicotine was addictive. Would you care to‚Äîyou still hold to that statement, or do you wish to recant or explain yourself?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Oh, that‚Äîthat\\'s very easy. My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes that they may be dangerous‚ÄîI voted‚ÄîI voted for everything since that time.\\n\\nIn fact, in 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the States had to comply or they\\'re going to lose certain money. We sent it to the Clinton administration for implementation. They waited 3 1/2 years. And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking. If you add it up, that\\'s about 3 million‚Äînot until again 1996.\\n\\nI don\\'t want anybody to smoke. My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes. I was asked a technical question: Are they addictive? Maybe they‚Äîthey probably are addictive. I don\\'t know; I\\'m not a doctor. You shouldn\\'t smoke. You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar‚Äî 30 years?\\n\\nQ. Yes.\\n\\nSenator Dole. And it seems to me that what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use in 12- and 17year-olds has doubled in this administration, the last 44 months. Marijuana use is up 141 percent; cocaine use, up 160 percent. They\\'re your kids. It\\'s all happened in this administration because they cut funding and they cut interdiction.\\n\\nWhen I\\'m President of the United States, we\\'re going to use the National Guard and whatever resources we need to stop some of the drugs coming into America. If you stop the drugs, nobody is going to use the drugs. So don\\'t smoke, don\\'t drink, don\\'t use drugs. Just don\\'t do it.\\n\\nThe President. Oscar, the question of what the Federal Government should do to limit the access of tobacco to young people is one of the biggest differences between Senator Dole and me.\\n\\nWe did propose a regulation 6 months after I became President under the law he mentioned. It simply says all these States‚Äîit made it illegal for kids to smoke‚Äînow they have to try harder if they want to keep getting Federal funds. Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments about how we ought to do it. That\\'s what drug it out.\\n\\nMeanwhile, we started, also in \\'93, to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market, and distribute tobacco products to our kids. No President had ever taken on the tobacco lobby before. I did. Senator Dole opposed me. He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side, saying that I did the wrong thing. I think I did the right thing.\\n\\nOn drugs, I have repeatedly said drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you. We have strengthened enforcement, and everybody in San Diego knows we\\'ve strengthened control of the border. We\\'ve done a lot more; I hope we get a chance to talk about it.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, they also know, if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you\\'re caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico; you\\'re not prosecuted. You have a U.S. Attorney here that sends them back home. So I think that\\'s pretty important. That\\'s a lot of marijuana. That\\'s a big supply.\\n\\nBut don\\'t‚Äîyou know, don\\'t get into this smokescreen here, Oscar. The President, in the election year, decided, \"Well, I ought to do something. I haven\\'t done anything on drugs. I\\'ve been AWOL for 44 months. So let\\'s take on smoking.\"\\n\\nBut see, they haven\\'t even done it. They haven\\'t said what\\'s going to happen, whether they\\'re going to have it declared addictive; it\\'s going to apply just to‚Äîonce it\\'s a drug, does it apply only to teenagers or to everybody in America?\\n\\nNobody should smoke, young or old. But particularly, young people should not smoke. And my record is there. It\\'s been there. I\\'ve voted 8, 10 times since 1965.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. The next question is for President Clinton, and it comes from right here. Yes, sir?\\n\\nSocial Security and Medicare\\n\\nQ. President Clinton, my name is Jack Fleck. I\\'m a retired Air Force pilot. Sir, it\\'s officially forecast that our annual Medicare and Social Security deficits are measured in the trillions of dollars next century. Depending upon who you listen to, Social Security will be bankrupt in either 2025 or 2030. I feel this is grossly unfair, especially to our younger generations, who are losing faith in the system.\\n\\nMy question is this: Assuming you agree that our entitlement programs are on an unsustainable course, what specific reforms do you propose?\\n\\nThe President. First of all, they\\'re two different things. Social Security and Medicare are entirely different in terms of the financial stabilities. Let\\'s talk about them separately.\\n\\nSocial Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century. But we\\'d like to have a Social Security fund that has about 70 years of life instead of about 30 years of life.\\n\\nWhat we have to do is simply to make some adjustments that take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us. And I think what we\\'ll plainly do is what we did in 1983, when Senator Dole served‚Äîand this is something I think he did a good job on‚Äî when he served on the Social Security Commission and they made some modest changes in Social Security to make sure that it would be alive and well into the 21st century. And we will do that. It\\'s obvious that there are certain things that have to be done, and there are 50 to 60 different options. And a bipartisan commission, to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people.\\n\\nMedicare is different. Medicare needs help now. I have proposed a budget which would put 10 years on the life of the Medicare Trust Fund; that\\'s more than it\\'s had a lot of the time for the last 20 years.\\n\\nIt would save a lot of money through more managed care but giving more options, more preventive care, and lowering the inflation rate in the prices we\\'re paying providers without having the kind of big premium increases and outof-pocket costs that the budget I vetoed would provide. Then that will give us 10 years to do with Medicare what we\\'re going to do with Social Security: have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire. But now we ought to pass this budget now and put 10 years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, again, you know, if you\\'re somebody thinking about the future, I think it\\'s fair to say that it\\'ll be‚Äîwe\\'ll work it out. I mean, this is a political year, and the President\\'s playing politics with Medicare. But after this year\\'s over we\\'ll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in 1983. It was a nonpartisan commission. Ronald Reagan got together with Tip O\\'Neill and Howard Baker‚Äîtwo Republicans and one Democrat‚Äîand they formed a commission. I was on that commission. We resolved‚Äîwe rescued Social Security. We suggested‚ÄîI think it\\'s been over a year ago now‚Äî we do the same with Medicare, and the White House called it a gimmick. Now last week, I guess it was, Donna Shalala said, \"Well, we\\'ll cut Medicare a hundred billion, and we\\'ll appoint a commission.\"\\n\\nIt will probably have to be done by a commission. Take it out of politics. I think if I were a senior citizen I\\'d be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans, and scaring students about education. But when you don\\'t have any ideas, when you don\\'t have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that\\'s all you can use. We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign, and we\\'ll rescue Medicare as we did Social Security.\\n\\nThe President. Their idea was to have the poorest seniors in the country pay $270 more a year this year. Their idea was to budget‚Äî that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals. Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed‚Äînot in an election year, sir, I told them in early \\'95.\\n\\nSenator Dole said 30 years ago he was one of 12 people that voted against Medicare and he was proud of it. A year ago he said, \"I was right then; I knew it wouldn\\'t work.\" American seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world. We need to reform it, not wreck it.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Next question from here, and it\\'s for Senator Dole. Yes, ma\\'am, right here.\\n\\nQ. Me?\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Yes.\\n\\nWelfare Reform\\n\\nQ. Senator Dole, my name is Suzanne Gonzalez, and I would like to know what you are‚Äî what would be your first step in reforming welfare.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, we\\'ve taken the first step. We took it three steps. Twice we sent welfare reform to the President, and he vetoed it. On the third time we sent welfare reform to the President, he signed it but announced he would change it next year. And the Vice President said they were going to do something else through the line item veto, which I\\'ve never understood, but that\\'s sort of inside baseball.\\n\\nWhat we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work. And I\\'m standing here as someone who a long time ago‚Äîas the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was to go through all the welfare checks and sign them. And three of those checks were my grandparents\\'. So I know what it\\'s like to have to look welfare head-on.\\n\\nObviously some people are going to need help. This is the United States of America. You\\'re not going to go without food, and you\\'re not going to go without medical care. This is America. But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we\\'re going to provide jobs. We\\'re going to say you have a 5-year limit that you can be on welfare. You\\'ve got 2 years to look for a job. We provided more money for day care in the bill that passed the Senate and was vetoed. Then it came back, and the President signed pretty much the same bill.\\n\\nBut this is an important issue. I don\\'t think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants. I mean, it puts a heavy burden on a State like‚Äîexcept for emergencies. It puts a heavy burden on States like California. It costs California taxpayers $3 billion a year.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. President Clinton?\\n\\nSenator Dole. I\\'ll get out of your way here.\\n\\nThe President. It\\'s illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits.\\n\\nLet me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me. I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly physically isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble. So I\\'d been working on it when I was a Governor for a long time.\\n\\nWhen I became President, I used the authority I had in this law to get out from under certain Federal rules to help States move people to work. We\\'ve reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already. Now I\\'ve got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector to give employers specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, to move more people from welfare to work. It\\'s very important. And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more. There is not a more important issue.\\n\\nI still remember a woman that I met 10 years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell‚Äîgive an answer when they say, \"What does your mother do for a job?\" I met that woman again. She\\'s got four kids. One\\'s got a good job; one\\'s studying to be a doctor; one\\'s in technical school; one\\'s an honor student in high school. I want to make more people like that woman, Lillie Harden. So I\\'ve got a plan to do it. And it\\'s just beginning.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, another thing we can do‚Äîwe talk about growth‚Äîwe\\'ve got a great economic package which I hope we\\'ll discuss later: across the board tax cut; child credits, $500 per child under 18; reduce the capital gains rate; create more jobs and opportunities for people on and off welfare.\\n\\nAnd we have other provisions: less litigation. The trial lawyers‚Äîbig supporters of the President‚Äîthe trial lawyers, of course they like lawsuits, so every time they have a bill that they want vetoed, the President vetoes it for them.\\n\\nWe\\'ve got to understand in America that we\\'ve got to have growth, create more jobs and more opportunities in the private sector. The President takes credit for all of these people off welfare‚Äîthe Governors did that. Federal Government doesn\\'t do that. And the Government doesn\\'t create jobs, they\\'re created in the private sector.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. This section, question? Yes, ma\\'am, on the back row. This is for the President.\\n\\nCapital Gains Tax\\n\\nQ. Mr. President, my name is Pamela Johnson, and I\\'m a landlord. My question is, does your party have any future plans to reduce the capital gains tax, especially for retired Americans?\\n\\nThe President. First of all, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes. Part of my tax package, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains for people when they sell their home, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans.\\n\\nWe also have a capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for 5 years. It was part of our other economic plan. And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.\\n\\nI think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a stronger economy. And we can\\'t have any tax cut that\\'s not paid for. One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I\\'m going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend. We\\'ve worked hard to bring this deficit down, and that\\'s helped people in the real estate business, because the interest rates are lower. We\\'ve got homeownership at a 15year high. We\\'ve got this country going in the right direction.\\n\\nSo we can have a tax cut, but my priority would be to help the families who need it with childrearing and education and buying a firsttime home and helping for health care costs. So from your business, helping in buying the first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about. Thank you, Pamela.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator Dole.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, Pamela, what the President didn\\'t tell you is that all his tax cuts expire at the year 2000, but all his increases go on forever. That\\'s the liberal approach. You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever. So the net tax increase in his plan is somewhere between $60 billion and $80 billion.\\n\\nWe have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless your home is worth over $500,000‚Äîand if it is, I appreciate it, congratulate you‚Äîbut in any event, no tax. And it\\'s a good idea. They saw it, and they picked it up and put in theirs, but it\\'s only temporary. Ours is permanent.\\n\\nOurs is a good plan: create jobs and opportunities; capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it from 28 percent to 14 percent. There are $7 trillion in assets locked up in America. If we cut the capital gains rate‚ÄîI\\'m told every day‚Äî I got a letter from a former constituent in Kansas saying, \"I want to sell property in California, put it in my business in Kansas. I can\\'t because the capital gains rate is too high.\"\\n\\nWe need to get the economy going. That will help Social Security. That will create more jobs. That will help people who want to get off welfare. It\\'s the American way.\\n\\nThe President. Before Senator Dole left the Senate, he and Mr. Gingrich also were recommending that we pass these tax cuts only insofar as we could pay for them. And we all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent, but we have to prove we can pay for them.\\n\\nAfter he left the Senate, we abandoned that. That\\'s why most experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the deficit, raise interest rates, and weaken the economy. And that will take away all the benefits of the tax cut with a weaker economy. That\\'s why we have to balance the budget. And I\\'ll tell you how I\\'m going to pay for anything I promise you, line by line. You should expect that from both of us.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right. The next question is for Senator Dole. Yes, ma\\'am, right there.\\n\\nResponding to American Youth\\n\\nQ. My name is Melissa Lydeana, and I\\'m a third-year student out at UC-San Diego. And I just want to say that it\\'s a great honor representing the voices of America. My question is concerning you, Mr. Dole, all the controversy regarding your age. How do you feel you can respond to young voices of America today and tomorrow?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, I think age is very‚Äîyou know, wisdom comes from age, experience, and intelligence. And if you have some of each‚Äî and I have some age, some experience, some intelligence‚Äî[laughter]‚Äîthat adds up to wisdom.\\n\\nI think it also is a strength; it\\'s an advantage. And I have a lot of young people work in my office, work in my campaign. This is about America. This is about‚Äîsomebody said earlier, one of the first questions, we\\'re together. It\\'s one America, one nation.\\n\\nI\\'m looking at our economic plan because I\\'m concerned about the future for young people. I\\'m looking about drugs. The President\\'s been AWOL for 4 years. I\\'m looking about crime. He\\'ll claim credit now for crime going down, but it happened because mayors and Governors and others have brought crime down. Rudy Giuliani, the mayor of New York, brought crime down 25 percent just in New York City, but of course the President will take credit for that.\\n\\nMy view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education. This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans, went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next 6 years‚Äî a 50 percent increase; the highest appropriation ever, $6 billion for Pell grants. Very, very important. And we also raised the amount of each Pell grant.\\n\\nIn our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people. Rolled over and over and over‚Äîof course, not this age, but if you have a child 2 years old, 7 percent interest, it would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college.\\n\\nThe President. I can only tell you that I don\\'t think Senator Dole is too old to be President. It\\'s the age of his ideas that I question.\\n\\nYou\\'re almost not old enough to remember this, but we\\'ve tried this before, promising people an election-year tax cut that\\'s not paid for‚Äî‚Äî\\n\\nSenator Dole. We tried it last time you ran.\\n\\nThe President. ‚Äî‚Äîtelling you you can have everything you got‚Äîand let me just say this: Did you hear him say the Congress just voted to increase student loans and scholarships? They did, after he left. The last budget he led cut Pell grants, cut student loans. I vetoed it when they shut the Government down.\\n\\nMy plan would give students a dollar-for-dollar reduction for the cost of the typical community college tuition, a $10,000 deduction a year for the cost of college tuition, would let families save in an IRA and withdraw tax-free to pay for the cost of education. And it\\'s all paid for.\\n\\nMy whole administration is about your future, it\\'s about what the 21st century is going to be like for you. And I hope you\\'ll look at the ideas in it.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, when you don\\'t have any ideas, I guess you say the other person\\'s ideas are old. As I said earlier, they don\\'t have any ideas. Their idea is to raise taxes and spend more money. That\\'s the liberal philosophy. If that\\'s what you like, you\\'ve got a perfect candidate.\\n\\nPresident Clinton came to California in 1992 and said, \"The centerpiece in my first 4 years is going to be a middle class tax cut.\" Now, to all you who got that tax cut, congratulations, because you got a big tax increase. You got a $265 billion tax increase. And he stands here and says politicians who make promises like that ought to be ignored. Well, he made the promise.\\n\\nI keep my word, and you\\'ll have a tax cut. It will help you in whatever you\\'re going to do in the next few years. Thank you.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Next question is for President Clinton, and it\\'s from‚Äîyes, ma\\'am? Yes?\\n\\nAffirmative Action\\n\\nQ. Hello. My name is Chessie Sanders, and my question is do you feel that America has grown enough and has educated itself enough to totally cut out affirmative action?\\n\\nThe President. No, ma\\'am, I don\\'t. I am against quotas; I\\'m against giving anybody any kind of preference for something they\\'re not qualified for, but because I still believe that there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an opportunity to prove they are qualified, I favor the right kind of affirmative action.\\n\\nI\\'ve done more to eliminate programs‚Äîaffirmative action programs that I didn\\'t think were fair and to tighten others up than my predecessors have since affirmative action has been around, but I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified.\\n\\nLet me just give you some examples. We\\'ve doubled the number of loans from the Small Business Administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people‚Äîno one unqualified. Everybody had to meet the standards. We\\'ve opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since I\\'ve been President, but the Joint Chiefs say we\\'re stronger and more competent and solid than ever.\\n\\nLet me give you another example of what I mean. To me, affirmative action is making that extra effort. It\\'s sort of like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act that said to certain stores, \"Okay, you\\'ve got to make it accessible to people with wheelchairs.\" We weren\\'t guaranteeing anything‚Äîanybody anything except the chance to prove they were qualified, the chance to prove that they could do it.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we\\'re not there yet. We ought to keep making those extra-effort affirmative action programs the law and the policy of the land.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator Dole.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, we may not be there yet, but we\\'re not going to get there by giving preferences and quotas. I supported that route for some time, and again, I think it gets back to experience‚Äîa little experience, a little age, a little intelligence. And I noticed that nobody was really benefiting except a very small group at the top. The average person wasn\\'t benefiting. People who had the money were benefiting. People who got all the jobs were benefiting.\\n\\nIt seems to me that we ought to support the California civil rights initiative. It ought to be not based on gender or ethnicity or color or disability. I\\'m disabled. I shouldn\\'t have a preference. I would like to have one in this race, come to think of it. But I don\\'t get one. Maybe we can work that out. I get a 10-point spot. [Laughter]\\n\\nThis is America. No discrimination. Discrimination ought to be punished, but there ought to be equal opportunity. We ought to reach out and make certain everybody has a chance to participate. Equal opportunity, but we cannot guarantee equal results in America. That\\'s not how America became the greatest country on the face of the Earth.\\n\\nThe President. I have never supported quotas. I\\'ve always been against them. They don\\'t favor equal results. But I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove they\\'re competent. The reason I have opposed that initiative is because I\\'m afraid it will end those extra-effort programs.\\n\\nAgain I say think of the American with Disabilities Act. Make an effort to put a ramp up there so someone in a wheelchair can get up. You don\\'t guarantee that they get the job; you guarantee they have a chance to prove they\\'re competent.\\n\\nAnd as I\\'ve said, this is not a partisan thing with me. General Powell, Colin Powell said the same thing. He fears that the initiative would take away the extra-effort programs. No preferences to unqualified people, no quotas, but don\\'t give up on making an extra effort till you\\'re sure everybody has a chance to prove they\\'re qualified.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right, the next question is for Senator Dole, and it comes from this section right here. The back row, there, in the blue shirt. Yes, sir.\\n\\nSenator Dole\\'s Tax Cut Proposal\\n\\nQ. My name\\'s Tim David. I\\'m a mechanical engineer. Senator Dole, how do you reduce taxes and balance the budget?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Oh, I\\'m glad you asked.\\n\\nThe President. So am I. I am too.\\n\\nSenator Dole. What\\'s your first name? Tim?\\n\\nI first want to say the President didn\\'t quite give you all the stuff on quotas, because the Justice Department entered what we call the Piscataway case up in New Jersey. It\\'s pretty clear that was a quota case. And just because one teacher was white and one teacher was black and they had the same qualification, you know, they decided who would stay there. It shouldn\\'t be that way.\\n\\nNow, the President can say, well, he wants to mend it, not end it. There are 168 Federal programs that allow quotas. He ended one.\\n\\nNow this economic package, Tim, I\\'m glad you asked because you look like the type that might be able to benefit from the 15 percent, across-the-board tax cut and $500-per-child tax credit or, you know, estate tax relief, which you\\'re not interested in right now, but capital gains rate reduction‚Äîif you\\'re taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction. We think that\\'s very important because a lot of people take care of their parents.\\n\\nHow do we pay for it? We\\'re going to have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated. He twisted arms, got six Democrats to vote with him. We lost by one vote. We\\'re going to balance the budget by the year 2002.\\n\\nThe President wants to spend 20 percent more over the next 6 years; I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people. Remember, it\\'s your money. It\\'s not his money, and it\\'s not my money. It\\'s your money, and you shouldn\\'t have to apologize for wanting to keep all you can of it, but he ought to apologize for wanting to take more and more. He wants to give you sort of a Government tax cut which really doesn\\'t mean anything.\\n\\nThe President. You know, one of the responsibilities of growing older, it seems to me, is being able to tell people something they may not want to hear just because it\\'s truth. When they had a $250 billion tax scheme‚Äîthat is half the size of this one, this one is 550‚Äîthey passed a budget that had $270 billion in Medicare cuts, the first education cuts in history, cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent, took away the guarantee of quality standards in nursing homes, took away the guarantee of health care to folks with disabilities.\\n\\nDon\\'t take my word for this. The Economist magazine polled lots of economists. Seven Nobel Prize winners have said, if this tax scheme passes, it will require huge cuts‚Äî40 percent‚Äî in the environment, in law enforcement, in education. It will require bigger cuts in Medicare than I vetoed last time. My targeted tax cut gives tax cuts for education, childrearing, buying a first-time home, paying for health care costs, and it\\'s paid for. And I\\'ve told you how I\\'ll pay for it. He won\\'t tell you because he can\\'t.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Your targeted tax cut, Mr. President, never hits anybody. That\\'s the problem with it. Nobody ever gets it.\\n\\nBut I must say I\\'m a little offended by this word \"scheme.\" You talked about‚Äîlast time you talked about a risky scheme, and then Vice President Gore repeated it about 10 times in St. Petersburg. If I have anything in politics, it\\'s my word. My colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will tell you that Bob Dole kept his word. I\\'m going to keep my word to you. I\\'m going to keep my word to the American people.\\n\\nWe\\'re going to cut taxes and balance the budget. We\\'re not going to touch Medicare. It\\'s going to grow 39 percent, and Social Security is going to grow 34 percent.\\n\\nNow, the President doesn\\'t have any ideas so he\\'s out trashing ours. This isn\\'t going to blow a hole in the deficit. He promised you a tax cut in 1992, and if you got one, you ought to vote for him.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Sir.\\n\\nThe next question is for the President.\\n\\nYes, sir, right there‚Äîwhite shirt.\\n\\nFamily and Medical Leave Act\\n\\nQ. My name is Dwayne Burns. I\\'m a martial arts instructor and a father. Mr. President, could you outline any plans you have to expand the family leave act?\\n\\nThe President. Thank you.\\n\\nWell, first let me say that I signed the family leave act. It was my very first bill, and I\\'m very proud of it because it symbolizes what I think we ought to be doing.\\n\\nI don\\'t take credit for all the good things that have happened in America, but I take credit for what I\\'ve tried to do to work with others to make good things happen.\\n\\nThe most important good things that happen in America happen in families. Just about every family I know, the main concern is how am I going to succeed at work and still do right by my children? Family and medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job. I\\'d like to see it expanded in two ways: I\\'d like to say you can also take a little time off without losing your job to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or to go to a regular doctor\\'s appointment with a family member; I\\'d also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flextime so that at the discretion of the worker‚Äî the worker‚Äîif you earn overtime you could decide whether you want that time to be taken in cash or in time with your family if you\\'ve got a family problem.\\n\\nI never go anywhere, it seems like, where I don\\'t meet somebody who\\'s benefited from the family leave law. In Longview, Texas, the other day, I met a woman who was almost in tears because she had been able to keep her job while spending time with her husband who had cancer. One of the people who\\'s here with me today met a woman in the airport saying that her son just was able to be present at the birth of his child because of the family leave law.\\n\\nSo yes, I think it should be expanded. We have to help people succeed at home and at work.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, 88 percent of the people the President claims, or 11 million, are already covered. And only 5 percent‚Äîkeep in mind, only 5 percent of the employers were even affected by the family leave act.\\n\\nWe had a better idea. We didn\\'t win, but we had a better idea. Now we have a majority; we need to get a President. That was a tax credit to the employer. Instead of the Federal Government reaching out, we had a tax credit to pick up some of the cost, because if you have to hire a replacement worker, that\\'s a cost. This is the way it ought to work. Give more power back to the States and back to the people, back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the Federal Government.\\n\\nBut keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the employers; 95 percent of the employers and all those employees they employ are not covered in this act. And according to Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88 percent of the people he claims credit for were already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements.\\n\\nWe had family leave in our office. I\\'m certain‚ÄîI see my friend Senator Mitchell. He had family leave. I work every day with people. I spent a lot of time in hospitals. I know what it\\'s like to be in a hospital. Sure, we want family leave, but there\\'s a better way to do it.\\n\\nThe President. I only have 30 seconds. I can\\'t fix the statistics. It covers the majority of the work force. Employers of under 50 are exempted. The bill originally covered employers of 25 and more, but because of opposition, we went up to 50. Senator Dole led the opposition to it. He filibustered it. He said it was a mistake. He said it would hurt the economy. We\\'ve had record numbers of new small businesses and 10 1/2 million jobs. It didn\\'t hurt the economy. He still believes it\\'s a mistake. I believe it was right. You can decide which of us you think are right. It\\'s up to you.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Next question for Senator Dole.\\n\\nThis side. Yes, ma\\'am.\\n\\nDomestic Manufacturing\\n\\nQ. Hi. My name is Bridget Gianotti, and I\\'m a wife and mother of two sons from Carlsbad. And my question for you, Senator Dole, is as the wife of a San Diego business owner, I see one of our biggest problems is the U.S. does not manufacture enough of our own products. How would you help this problem out?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, right, we\\'ve lost 357,000 manufacturing jobs. And the Bureau of Labor Statistics said today that they made a mistake, it\\'s probably going to be a much, much higher figure. So we\\'re talking about all these new jobs, we\\'d better wait and see what the results are.\\n\\nWe\\'re going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy. We\\'re going to do that with an economic package. We\\'re going to do that with regulatory reform. You know, regulations cost the average family‚Äîright here, Democrat or Republican‚Äîabout $7,000 a year‚Äî7,000. It\\'s like a tax. Put a lot of people out of business.\\n\\nI met a lady in Colorado Springs about 7 weeks ago, now. She had a small business with 63 employees. She finally gave it up. Why? Because of paperwork and regulation. Congress passed the Paperwork Reduction Act. The President exempts the IRS, which creates threefourths of the paperwork.\\n\\nWe\\'re going to have regulatory‚Äîwe\\'re going to have litigation reform. You know, I fell off a platform out in California, in Chico, a while back. Before I hit the ground, my cell phone rang, and this trial lawyer says, \"I think we\\'ve got a case here.\" [Laughter] You know, we\\'ve got to stop some of these frivolous lawsuits. They\\'re putting people out of business, men and women. Get the economy going, cut the capital gains rate, create more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America‚Äîthat\\'s what we will do, and my word is good. I keep my promises. I don\\'t break my promises after the election, and I don\\'t make new promises on an election year.\\n\\nWe\\'re going to get it done; we\\'re going to grow some of these jobs in America because we need to get it. They\\'re going the wrong way.\\n\\nThe President. Let\\'s look at the facts. We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs in the 12 years before I became President. We\\'ve gained manufacturing jobs since I\\'ve been President. We\\'ve negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements.\\n\\nLet\\'s just take California. In California, we made $37 billion worth of telecommunications equipment eligible for exports for the first time. We\\'re selling everything from telephones to CD\\'s to rice in Japan. We\\'re selling American automobiles in Japan now. I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan. We\\'re number one in automobile manufacturing, production, and sales around the world again for the first time since the 1970\\'s. Why? Because we\\'ve had tough, aggressive trade policies, and because we got interest rates down, and we had a good, stable economic policy, because we\\'ve reduced the deficit 4 years in a row for the first time in the 20th century that a President\\'s done that in all 4 years.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s why I don\\'t want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can\\'t pay for so your interest rates will go up and you\\'ll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut.\\n\\nSo I say keep working on expanding the markets. More than half of these 10 1/2 million new jobs were in higher wage areas, and we\\'ll have more manufacturing and more sales at home and around the world.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, you may think the biggest employer in America is General Motors, but I\\'ve got news for you. It\\'s manpower services, hiring people temporarily who\\'ve lost their jobs and they go to work for 30 days or 60 days. That\\'s a good economy? I don\\'t think so. They\\'re setting new records this year.\\n\\nWe have the worst economy in a century. We have the slowest growth, about 2.5 percent. The President inherited a growth of over 5 percent. We don\\'t have the S&L crisis anymore. Republicans have cut $53 billion in spending. That\\'s why the budget can look good. It didn\\'t look too good the first 2 years when we had a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. The next question is for President Clinton. Yes, sir?\\n\\nGay Rights\\n\\nQ. I\\'m Bob Goldfarb. I\\'m a travel agent. And can you please explain your policy on the employment nondiscrimination act that would have prohibited discrimination, would have prohibited people from being fired from their jobs simply for being gay or lesbian?\\n\\nThe President. I\\'m for it. That\\'s my policy. I\\'m for it. I believe that any law-abiding taxpaying citizen who shows up in the morning and doesn\\'t break the law and doesn\\'t interfere with his or her neighbors ought to have the ability to work in our country and shouldn\\'t be subject to unfair discrimination. I\\'m for it.\\n\\nNow, I have a little time left, so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions it\\'s hard to answer all those things. In February‚ÄîSenator Dole just said we had the worst economy in a century. In February he said we had the best economy in 30 years‚Äî just February. And I don\\'t want to respond in kind to all these things. I could; I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat. But I hope we can talk about what we\\'re going to do in the future. No attack ever created a job or educated a child or helped a family make ends meet. No insult ever cleaned up a toxic waste dump or helped an elderly person. Now, for 4 years that\\'s what I\\'ve worked on. If you\\'ll give me 4 years more, I\\'ll work on it some more.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll try to answer these charges, but I prefer to emphasize direct answers to the future, and I gave you a direct answer.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator Dole?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, I\\'m opposed to discrimination in any form, but I\\'m‚Äîbut I don\\'t favor creating special rights for any group. That would be my answer to this question. And I\\'m‚Äîyou know, there\\'d be special rights for different groups in America, but I\\'m totally opposed to discrimination, don\\'t have any policy against hiring anyone‚Äîwhether it\\'s lifestyle or whatever, we don\\'t have any policy of that kind, never have had in my office, nor will we have in the future.\\n\\nBut as far as special rights, I\\'m opposed to same-sex marriages, which the President signed well after midnight one morning, in the dark of night‚Äîhe opposed it.\\n\\nBut I\\'ll get back to the economic package because again, I think this is very important. If there is anything that\\'s going to change America, it\\'s get the economy to grow. The President inherited a good economy‚Äîsure. The S&L crisis ended, we were selling assets, we had a Republican Congress cutting spending finally, and he says we\\'ve had the best 4 years ever. That\\'s not true. We\\'ve had over 1.2 million bankruptcies‚Äîset a new record. Credit card debt has never been higher. I just told you about this manufacturing job loss which is going to increase.\\n\\nWe need a good, strong economic package. Let the private sector create the jobs. And they can do it.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Mr. President?\\n\\nThe President. If you believe that the California economy was better in 1992 than it is today, you should vote for Bob Dole. I have worked so hard out here to help turn this economy around.\\n\\nLet me just give you one tiny example. In San Diego, where we had some defense cutbacks, we funded a project with the University of California, San Diego to use airplane composite materials to build lighter, stronger bridges‚Äî\\n\\na little project, and a program that Senator Dole opposed‚Äîand that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica freeway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs. That\\'s just one tiny example. Maybe we\\'ll talk about some more before it\\'s over.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. The next question is for Senator Dole and it\\'s from this section.\\n\\nYes, ma\\'am? Yes?\\n\\nHealth Care\\n\\nQ. Senator Dole, I am Verda Stratigus, and I work in health care. And it\\'s truly an honor to be here tonight to address both of you.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Thank you.\\n\\nQ. Being in health care‚Äîwe have talked a little bit about health care tonight, but mainly MediCal and Medicare have been mentioned, but the private sector is a problem. Managed care is taking over, especially in California, and because of that, the quality of care is going downhill. There are many, many people who cannot get the tests that they need when they need them. And because of that, they are dying needlessly. There are many, many more lawsuits being presented against the managed care industry because of this. And I think it\\'s a real problem that needs to be addressed. What would you do if you were President?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, one thing I did was to oppose the Government takeover of health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened. Everybody would have been forced into managed care. You couldn\\'t have chosen your own doctor. And that would have been the end.\\n\\nAnd I think right now we\\'ve got to go back‚Äî I know they\\'ve appointed a commission to take a look at managed care. Maybe that\\'s part of the answer. But it seems to me, if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, if we eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you\\'ve got to go somewhere else, then I think we\\'ve taken a giant step backward in the United States of America.\\n\\nWe have the best health care delivery system in the world, and we want to keep it that way. That\\'s why we opposed the Government takeover health care plan that President Clinton tried and tried and tried to get through Congress.\\n\\nDidn\\'t get it done. When it ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug. It was a big, big mistake. Now, whether or not he\\'ll do that again, I\\'ve heard some of the people say, \"Well, that\\'s the model we ought to use.\" And if he\\'s reelected, maybe he\\'ll come back and try it again. I hope not. I hope not in both cases. But it does seem to me that you\\'ve raised a very important point that needs to be addressed. We\\'re going to have to watch it, going to have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or we\\'re going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world.\\n\\nThe President. I\\'m just curious. How many of you are under managed care plans? Raise your hand if you\\'re in managed care.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Probably the young people here.\\n\\nThe President. How many of you like it? Well‚Äî‚Äî\\n\\nSenator Dole. Two.\\n\\nThe President. One of the things that I tried to do was to make sure that everybody in the country who was under a managed care plan should at least have three choices of plans and would have the right to get out without penalty every year. Now, that\\'s not a Government takeover, that\\'s like the family and medical leave law. It just tries to set the rules of the game.\\n\\nI\\'m strongly in favor of a Federal bill to repeal the‚Äîany gag rules on providers. In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.\\n\\nIf we\\'re saving money and managing resources better, that\\'s a good thing. If we\\'re saving money and depriving people of care, that\\'s a bad thing. A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor telling the patient, \"You need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure. Your health requires it.\"\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator Dole?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, I don\\'t have any quarrel with that. I think that would help. But I think what we want to avoid is falling back into this nationalized health care system that President Clinton wanted to give us in 1993. If that isn\\'t a liberal idea, I\\'ve never heard one: 17 new taxes; price controls; 50 new bureaucracies. We\\'d have that trouble all over America.\\n\\nWe need to deal with managed care. It not only happened in California, it\\'s happening in other States that we visit too. It\\'s a national problem, not just a State problem.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. The next question is for President Clinton, and in this section. Yes, ma\\'am. Yes.\\n\\nParticipation in Electoral Process\\n\\nQ. All right, I\\'d sort of like to‚ÄîColeen O\\'Connor. I teach history and political science at San Diego Mesa College right up the road here. And I\\'d like to tee off from the original question by another teacher and speak for those people that aren\\'t here tonight. Sixty-three percent of the American people are not participating, that are eligible to vote, not even participating in the process. Several parties can\\'t even get into the debate: the Green Party, the Reform Party, the Natural Law Party. All of these people have basically opted out of what we\\'re still participating in.\\n\\nAnd if we in fact are going to bring the country back together and be all faces around the table, the new American family, what do you see as something the President can do to begin that process to bring them back in?\\n\\nThe President. First of all, I think it\\'s important to make voting more accessible. That\\'s why I strongly supported the motor voter law. There was a big story, I think, in USA Today about the millions of people who\\'ve now registered because of it.\\n\\nSecondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible. You know, several States now are letting people vote over 3 weeks. A lot of people are busy, and it\\'s hard for them to just get there and vote.\\n\\nThe third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform, because if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airwaves, because what drives the cost of a campaign are the costs of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing. And if you open the airwaves to more things like this‚Äîyou see, it\\'s not just you that are participating here. For every one of you who stood up here and asked a question tonight, I promise you, there\\'s 100,000 Americans that said, \"I wish I could have asked that question.\"\\n\\nSo I think we have to change the nature of politics. The last thing I think we should do is something I\\'ve been trying to do since I\\'ve been President, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country in Washington with more police on the street in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here.\\n\\nThose are my best ideas about it.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, I don\\'t know of any perfect solution. I\\'ve been in politics for some time, and I worry about people who don\\'t vote. And I wonder if it\\'s our fault, the candidates\\' fault. People say \"I don\\'t care. One vote doesn\\'t make a difference.\" I can give you hundreds of cases‚Äîyou can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference. I know it made a lot of difference many times in the Congress. Campaign finance might help, might help contributions coming in from Indonesia or other foreign countries, rich people in those countries, and then being sent back after the L.A. Times discovers it‚Äî$250,000.\\n\\nBut maybe there ought to be more debates. I\\'d be willing to have another debate this year where we\\'d invite all of the candidates and talk about the economy. If we don\\'t get the economy to grow, if we don\\'t cut taxes, and give people child credits, and cut the capital gains rate, and get this economy growing, we\\'re going to limp into the next century. If we grow the economy, it\\'s going to help Social Security, it\\'s going to help jobs, it\\'s going to help everything.\\n\\nThe President. Let me make one other suggestion. As you\\'re a teacher, you can have an impact on that.\\n\\nOne of the things I think that really frustrates people is that so often, political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people. Now, there is a connection, and I think what we have to do is convince people there\\'s a big difference. If you vote one way, you will have a Department of Education in the 21st century; if you vote the other way, you won\\'t. If you vote one way, you\\'ll have an expansion of family leave; if you vote the other way, you\\'ll be lucky to save it.\\n\\nBut these are important questions, and people have to decide. I think that the American people also need to be a little more responsible and think about whether there\\'s a connection in their lives and what we do in Washington.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. For Senator Dole, in this section. On the back row, yes, ma\\'am.\\n\\nSocial Security and Alternatives\\n\\nQ. I\\'m Iris Seiffert, and I\\'m unemployed.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Iris?\\n\\nQ. Iris. Senator Dole, we talked about Social Security for us baby boomers, but shouldn\\'t we be saving and investing for our own retirement as well? Are you planning any incentives to encourage us to take care of ourselves rather than to rely on the Government and on Social Security when we retire?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, we have in our economic pack individual retirement accounts where we think it\\'ll encourage savings. You could also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home. We\\'re doing that precisely. And I think one thing sooner or later we\\'re going to have to consider is to take a look at the Social Security system, because we\\'ve got a lot of people advocating that, well, we don\\'t want to put our money into Social Security. Now, you\\'ve got to be very careful about that, because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline. But it\\'s something you might consider. I\\'m not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it.\\n\\nIt\\'s been looked‚Äîwhen I was chairman of the Finance Committee, which handles Social Security, we looked at all these options, and one thing we\\'ve got to make certain‚Äîwhen I used to go home, my mother would tell me, \"All I\\'ve got is my Social Security; don\\'t touch it.\" And we didn\\'t touch it. We preserved it.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m an optimist. Your Social Security is going to be there when you retire. We\\'ll fix it. It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015. In 1983, we thought we had a 75year fix. It didn\\'t work‚Äîmuch, much less. But at least we fixed it for some time, and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time.\\n\\nSo we need to preserve the system, and we need to make it stronger. But we also need to look at some options whether or not we‚Äî it would depend on what the options are. In fact, they\\'ve got a commission right now in Congress, a bipartisan commission, looking at all the different options they\\'re going to present to the next Congress. So I think we\\'ll wait and see what they present, take a look at it.\\n\\nThe President. This is one where we have some agreement, I think. Only about half the people in this country have pension plans, and Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least it\\'s not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle. So we\\'ve got to figure out how we\\'re going to have more people with pension plans. And pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses.\\n\\nSo what is in my plan‚Äîand I think it\\'s almost identical to what\\'s in Senator Dole\\'s plan‚Äîis we make more people than are now eligible to save in an IRA, and we\\'d let couples‚Äîmarried couples save more, and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to for medical emergencies or to buy a home or for an education, but they could also save to supplement their retirement.\\n\\nIn addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small-business people to take out 401(k) plans for themselves and their employees and then much easier for employees to carry it from job to job. My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman, and he told me last time he changed employers it took him 9 months to figure out how to transfer his 401(k) plan. Now, none of that will happen anymore. And so I hope that over the next 10 years you\\'ll see a big increase in the percentage of people that have pension plans plus a secure Social Security System.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Did you say you\\'re unemployed? The first thing we ought to do is get you a job. And that\\'s the economic package again: Create jobs and opportunities, reduce the capital gains rate, reduce regulatory reform, stop some of this senseless litigation, and let people work in America. And I think that\\'s the thrust we will make.\\n\\nObviously, Social Security is a very important program. It\\'ll be preserved‚ÄîDemocrats or Republicans. It\\'ll be preserved. We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline, just as we did back in 1983. And we did it on a bipartisan basis. We took it out of politics. People get so tired of politics. And we ought to do the same with Medicare. Maybe we could make a deal here tonight.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right, the question is for President Clinton. Does anybody have a foreign affairs question in this section? Yes, sir.\\n\\nTrade With Japan\\n\\nQ. Good evening. I\\'m Michael Smith. I\\'m an electronics technician in the Navy. My question was how you plan to deal with the trade deficit with Japan?\\n\\nThe President. Let me tell you what we have done. We have concluded with Japan 21, about to be 22 trade agreements now. And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded trade agreements, our exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last 4 years, and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down. Until about 5 months ago, the Japanese economy was in a deep recession. It\\'s coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it\\'ll go down more.\\n\\nBut I\\'m very‚Äîthat\\'s one of the real success stories here of the work we\\'ve done. We\\'re selling Japanese rice from California for the first time. I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo. I visited a Jeep plant, the oldest auto plant in America, in Toledo, Ohio, where they\\'re going to export 41,000 right-hand-drive Jeeps this year, and they\\'ve got 700 new jobs because of it.\\n\\nThere is no easy way to do this. When you\\'re dealing with an economy that\\'s traditionally been more closed and one that\\'s traditionally been more open, you just have to gut it out issue by issue by issue. We agreed in principle on our insurance agreement, and we\\'re working on three or four other areas now. But the way you have to do it is make sure you\\'re competitive‚Äîwe\\'re the most competitive country in the world now‚Äîand then just fight to open those markets and go try to make the sale. And that\\'s what our trade ambassador, our Commerce Secretary, and all the other people in our administration have tried to do.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, the bottom line is we\\'ve got to stop exporting jobs. We need to keep jobs here. I said there are 357,000 good jobs, manufacturing jobs, which were lost. And I assume some of those because of our trading partners; we didn\\'t have access to their markets. We ought to insist on access. If we don\\'t have access to their markets the same way they have access to our markets, we ought to say, \"Wait, that\\'s enough. Time out. When you give us access, we\\'ll give you access.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s very hard to get into the Japanese market, as everybody knows. They want to get into our market. They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs‚Äîthose who sell exports. And it\\'s very important to the economy. But I think we want to make certain.\\n\\nI supported the President\\'s trade policy, but we\\'ve got to be more aggressive. Once you have a policy, then you\\'ve got to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy. There are American jobs that are being lost. This is what Ross Perot complains about. And I\\'d say to the Reform Party, take a look at the Republican Party. We\\'re the reform party, and we\\'re going to make things better. And one of the things we\\'re going to do is stop exporting jobs in America.\\n\\nThe President. Let me say again, we\\'ve had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last 4 years, by far the largest number in American history, not just the big ones you\\'ve read about but a lot of smaller ones. And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we\\'re real good at and make sure we\\'re getting a fair deal.\\n\\nWe just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CD\\'s and costing thousands of jobs in places like California. But we said, \"You know, if you want to keep doing business and selling your products over here, you\\'re going to have to quit pirating our CD\\'s.\" And they agreed to do a number of things and to let us verify that they\\'d done it. But I think they\\'re going to make the problem much better.\\n\\nBut there is not a simple, easy answer. You just have to work on this day-in and day-out, every month, every year, every issue to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair trade. I\\'m proud that we\\'re better off on that than we were 4 years ago.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right, the next question is for Senator Dole, and it\\'s in this section. Yes, sir.\\n\\nReligion and Values\\n\\nQ. Ron Kite, minister.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Hi, Ron.\\n\\nQ. This great Nation has been established by the Founding Fathers, who possessed very strong Christian beliefs and godly principles. If elected President of the United States, what could you do to return this Nation to these basic principles? And also, do you feel that the office of the President has the responsibility to set the role example to inspire our young people?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, no doubt about it, our Founding Fathers had a great deal of wisdom. And in addition to what you mentioned, they also were concerned about this all-powerful central Government in Washington, DC, that would in effect confiscate your property. So I carry around in my pocket‚ÄîI can\\'t pull it out, I\\'d violate the rules‚Äîa copy of the 10th amendment, which says that we ought to return power to the States and power to the people‚Äîpeople here. You ought to make more decisions.\\n\\nHonor, duty, and country: that\\'s what America is all about. Certainly the President of the United States, in the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlier‚Äîto everyone, by example. And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility. When you have 30-some in your administration who\\'ve either left or are being investigated or in jail or whatever, then you\\'ve got an ethical problem. It\\'s public ethics‚ÄîI\\'m not talking about private, we\\'re talking about public ethics‚Äîwhen you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who was a bouncer in a bar and hired as a security officer to collect files. In Watergate, I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file. There are 900 sequestered in the White House‚Äî900‚Äî people like you. Why should they be rifling through your files?\\n\\nSo the President has a great responsibility. And it\\'s one that I understand and would certainly carry out.\\n\\nThe President. This is the most religious great country in history, and yet, interestingly enough, we have the most religious freedom of any country in the world, including the freedom not to believe. And now we have all these people‚Äî just up the road in Los Angeles County we\\'ve got people from 150 different racial and ethnic groups, and they\\'ve got tons of different religions. But the fundamental tenets of virtually every religion are the same. And what I\\'ve tried to do is to support policies that would respect religion, and then help parents inculcate those values to their children. Let me very briefly give you some examples.\\n\\nOne of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which says the Government\\'s got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice. So I changed a Justice Department effort to get a church to pay back a man\\'s tithe because he was bankrupt when he gave it.\\n\\nI\\'ve supported character education programs in our schools, drug-free schools programs. I\\'ve supported giving parents a V-chip on their television so if they don\\'t want their young kids to watch things they shouldn\\'t watch, they wouldn\\'t have to. That\\'s the kind of thing we need to do, give people like you and our families the power to give those values to our children.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, I think it\\'s‚Äîyou know, before I came in tonight, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer because if it\\'s God\\'s will, whatever happens‚Äîif it\\'s God\\'s will, it will happen.\\n\\nA constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer in school in my view would be a great idea. I support it, and the President opposes it. I mean, it seems to me the President, whoever the President may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities. People look to the President of the United States more than any other person in America. And that\\'s the way it\\'s always been, and that\\'s the way it always will be.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right, this is our last question. It goes to President Clinton, and it\\'s from this section.\\n\\nYes, ma\\'am?\\n\\n\"Special Rights\"\\n\\nQ. My name is Evette Duby, and I too am a minister; I\\'m with the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches.\\n\\nPresident Clinton, perhaps you can help me with something tonight. I\\'ve heard Mr. Dole say several times, \"all of us together.\" And when he was asked if he would support equal rights in employment for gay and lesbian people, you said that you favored that, and he said that he did not believe in special rights. And I thought the question was equal rights for all people, and I don\\'t understand why people are using the term \"special rights\" when the question is equal rights. Could you help me in understanding that?\\n\\nThe President. I want to answer your question, but let me say one other thing. We don\\'t need a constitutional amendment for kids to pray. And what I did was to have the Justice Department and the Education Department, for the first time ever, issue a set of guidelines that we gave to every school in America saying that children could not be interfered with in religious advocacy, when they were praying, when they were doing whatever they could do under the Constitution just because they were on a public school grounds. And I think anyone who has experienced this would tell you that our administration has done more than any in 30 years to clarify the freedom of religion in the public square, including in the public schools.\\n\\nNow, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself. It wouldn\\'t be fair for me to do that. I would wind up‚ÄîI mean, it\\'s the last question, and I\\'d mischaracterize it to try to make you happy.\\n\\nLet me tell you what I feel. We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people\\'s decisions are wrong, even immoral. But under our Constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard, and you do what you are supposed to do, you\\'re entitled to equal treatment. That\\'s the way the system works.\\n\\nAll over the world, people are being torn apart‚ÄîBosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi, you name it‚Äîbecause of all their differences. We still have some of that hatred inside us; you see it in the church burnings. And one of the things I\\'ve tried hardest to do is to tell the American people that we have to get beyond that, we have to understand that we\\'re stronger when we unite around shared values instead of being divided by our differences.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Senator Dole?\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, I hope I made my answer clear. I said I\\'m opposed to discrimination. You know, we\\'ve suffered discrimination in the disability community. There are 43 million of us. And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair.\\n\\nSo we want to end discrimination. I think that answers itself. No discrimination in America. We\\'ve made that clear. And I would just say that it seems to me that that\\'s the way it ought to be. We shouldn\\'t discriminate‚Äîrace, color, whatever, lifestyle, disability. This is America, and we\\'re all proud of it. But we\\'re not there yet. What we need is good, strong leadership going into the next century.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry we didn\\'t have a foreign policy question, because just this week Secretary Christopher said, \"Well, we really didn\\'t know much the first couple of years about foreign policy.\" Now, that was quite an admission. It underscores what I had to say in the Hartford debate, that there is really no foreign policy in this administration. It\\'s sort of ad hoc: \"Whatever comes up, we\\'ll deal with it.\" Unfortunately, we didn\\'t have more questions on that.\\n\\nThe President. Let me say again, there is no more important responsibility for the President than to say, \"If you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, that\\'s all we need to know. And you can be part of our America, and you can walk across that bridge to the 21st century with us.\"\\n\\nAnd we are not well served when we attack each other in a kind of an ad hominem way. It doesn\\'t create jobs. It doesn\\'t educate children. It doesn\\'t solve problems. We need to be disagreeing on ideas honestly and talking about the future. The future will be the greatest time in this country\\'s history if we can beat this division that is bedeviling the whole rest of the world.\\n\\nClosing Statements\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. All right. Now we go to the closing statements. Senator Dole, you\\'re first. Two minutes, sir.\\n\\nSenator Dole. Well, let me thank everybody here at the university, and Jim, thank you, all the people who may still be watching or viewing. This is what it\\'s all about. It\\'s not about me. It\\'s not about President Clinton. It\\'s about the process. It\\'s about selecting a President of the United States.\\n\\nSo we have our differences. We should have our differences. I mentioned other parties. They have their differences. If we all agreed, it\\'d be a pretty dull place. We should have more debates. Maybe we\\'ll have another debate on the economy.\\n\\nBut I would just say this: This is the highest honor that I have ever had in my life, to think that somebody from Russell, Kansas, somebody who grew up living in a basement apartment, somebody whose parents didn\\'t finish high school, somebody who spent about 39 months in hospitals after World War II, somebody who uses a buttonhook every day to get dressed, somebody who understands that there are real Americans out there with real problems, whether soccer moms or the single parents or families working or seniors or people with disabilities, whoever it may be.\\n\\nBut there are some very fundamental differences in this campaign. President Clinton opposes term limits. President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. President Clinton opposes a voluntary prayer amendment. He opposes an amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America. People give their lives‚Äîa couple of servicemen here‚Äîthey sacrifice, they give everything for America. We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment.\\n\\nBut beyond that, we need to address the economy. And I would just say, with my time running out here, it\\'s a very proud moment for me. And what I want the voters to do is to make a decision. And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead, proud that they voted for the right candidate, proud that they voted, hopefully, for me.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll just make you one promise. My word is good. Democrats and Republicans have said Bob Dole\\'s word is good. I keep my word. I promise you, the economy is going to get better, we\\'re going to have a good economic package, and we\\'re going into the next century a better America.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Mr. President.\\n\\nThe President. Thank you, Jim. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and all the people who are watching.\\n\\nOne thing I\\'d like to say is I agree with what Senator Dole said. It\\'s a remarkable thing in a country like ours that a man who grew up in Russell, Kansas, and one who was born to a widowed mother in Hope, Arkansas, could wind up running for President, could have a chance to serve as President. So the first thing I want to say is thank you for giving me the chance to be President.\\n\\nThis election is about two different visions about how we should go into the 21st century. Would we be better off‚Äîas I believe‚Äîworking together to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our God-given potential, or are we better off saying, \"You\\'re on your own\"? Would we be better off building that bridge to the future together so we can all walk across it, or saying, \"You can get across yourself\"?\\n\\nIf you don\\'t leave this room with anything else tonight and if the people watching us don\\'t leave with anything else, I hope you\\'ll leave with this: This is a real important election. The world is changing dramatically in how we work and how we live, how we relate to each other‚Äî huge changes. And the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences.\\n\\nSo we\\'ve talked about our responsibilities tonight. I want to talk about your responsibility and your responsibility. Your responsibility is to show up on November 5th, because you\\'re going to decide whether we\\'re going to balance the budget now but protect Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment. You\\'ll decide whether we\\'re going to keep fighting crime with the Brady bill, the assault weapons, and finish putting those 100,000 police; whether we\\'re going to move a million people from welfare to work; whether we\\'re going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns; whether we\\'re going to give our children world-class education where every 8-year-old can read, every 12-yearold can log in on the Internet, every 18-yearold can go to college.\\n\\nIf we do those things, we\\'ll build that bridge to the 21st century, and the greatest country in history will be even greater.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nMr. Lehrer. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nThis concludes‚Äîthis is the last of the three 1996 Presidential and Vice Presidential debates.'}, {'file': '80_debate_1', 'content': 'MRS. HINERFELD. Good evening.\\n\\nI\\'m Ruth Hinerfeld of the League of Women Voters Education Fund. Next Tuesday is election day. Before going to the polls, voters want to understand the issues and know the candidates\\' positions. Tonight, voters will have an opportunity to see and hear the major party candidates for the Presidency state their views on issues that affect us all. The League of Women Voters is proud to present this Presidential debate.\\n\\nOur moderator is Howard K. Smith.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Thank you, Mrs. Hinerfeld.\\n\\nThe League of Women Voters is pleased to welcome to the Cleveland, Ohio, Convention Center Music Hall President Jimmy Carter, the Democratic Party\\'s candidate for reelection to the Presidency, and Governor Ronald Reagan of California, the Republican Party\\'s candidate for the Presidency. The candidates will debate questions on domestic, economic, foreign policy, and national security issues.\\n\\nThe questions are going to be posed by a panel of distinguished journalists who are here with me. They are: Marvin Stone, the editor of U.S. News and World Report; Harry Ellis, national correspondent of the Christian Science Monitor; William Hilliard, assistant managing editor of the Portland Oregonian; Barbara Walters, correspondent, ABC News.\\n\\nThe ground rules for this, as agreed by you gentlemen, are these: Each panelist down here will ask a question, the same question, to each of the two candidates. After the two candidates have answered, a panelist will ask followup questions to try to sharpen the answers. The candidates will then have an opportunity each to make a rebuttal. That will constitute the first half of the debate, and I will state the rules for the second half later on.\\n\\nSome other rules: The candidates are not permitted to bring prepared notes to the podium, but are permitted to make notes during the debate. If the candidates exceed the allotted time agreed on, I will reluctantly but certainly interrupt. We ask the Convention Center audience here to abide by one ground rule: Please do not applaud or express approval or disapproval during the debate.\\n\\nNow, based on a toss of the coin, Governor Reagan will respond to the first question from Marvin Stone.\\n\\nQUESTIONS\\n\\nU.S. ARMED FORCES\\n\\nMR. STONE. Governor, as you\\'re well aware, the question of war and peace has emerged as a central issue in this campaign in the give-and-take of recent weeks. President Carter\\'s been criticized for responding late to aggressive Soviet impulses, for insufficient buildup of our Armed Forces, and a paralysis in dealing with Afghanistan and Iran. You have been criticized for being all too quick to advocate the use of lots of muscle, military action, to deal with foreign crises. Specifically, what are the differences between the two of you on the uses of American military power?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. I don\\'t know what the differences might be, because I don\\'t know what Mr. Carter\\'s policies are. I do know what he has said about mine. And I\\'m only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.\\n\\nNow, I believe, also that this meeting, this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, that we cannot shirk our responsibility as the leader of the Free World, because we\\'re the only one that can do it. And therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us. And to maintain that peace requires strength. America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong. We can get into a war by letting events get out of hand, as they have in the last 3√Ç¬º years under the foreign policies of this administration of Mr. Carter\\'s, until we\\'re faced each time with a crisis. And good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis.\\n\\nBut I have seen four wars in my lifetime. I\\'m a father of sons; I have a grandson. I don\\'t ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in Asia, or the muddy, bloody battlefields of Europe.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Mr. Stone, do you have a followup question for the Governor?\\n\\nMR. STONE. Yes. Governor, we\\'ve been hearing that the defense buildup that you would associate yourself with would cost tens of billions of dollars more than is now contemplated. In assuming that the American people are ready to bear this cost, they nevertheless keep asking the following question: How do you reconcile huge increases in military outlays with your promise of substantial tax cuts and of balancing the budget, which in this fiscal year, the one that just ended, ran more than $60 billion in the red?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Mr. Stone, I have submitted an economic plan that I\\'ve worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country, all of whom approve it, and believe that over a 5-year projection, this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture, that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983, if not earlier, and that we can afford-along with the cuts that I have proposed in Government spending ‚Äî we can afford the tax cuts I have proposed ‚Äî and probably, mainly because Mr. Carter\\'s economic policy has built into the next 5 years, and on beyond that, a tax increase that will be taking $86 billion more next year out of the people\\'s pockets than was taken this year. And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase. I\\'m only reducing the amount of the increase.\\n\\nIn other words, what I\\'m talking about is not putting Government back to getting less money than Government\\'s been getting, but simply cutting the increase in spending.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. The same question now goes to President Garter. President Carter, would you like to have the question repeated?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes.\\n\\nMR. STONE. Yes, President Carter, the question of war and peace, a central issue in this campaign. You\\'ve been criticized in the give-and-take for responding late to aggressive Soviet impulses, for an insufficient buildup of our Armed Forces, and a paralysis in dealing with Afghanistan and Iran. Governor Reagan, on the other hand, has been criticized for being all too quick to advocate the use of lots of muscle, military action, to deal with foreign crises such as I mentioned. Specifically, what are the differences between the two of you on the uses of American military power?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Mr. Stone, I\\'ve had to make thousands of decisions since I\\'ve been President, serving in the Oval Office. And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process. I think I\\'m a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated 4 years ago against President Ford. I\\'ve also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions. H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there\\'s a simple answer. It would be neat and plausible ‚Äî and wrong.\\n\\nThe fact is that this Nation, in the 8 years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased. Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37 percent, in all. Since I\\'ve been in office, we\\'ve had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but very effective increase in our commitment for defense.\\n\\nBut what we\\'ve done is to use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace. We\\'ve not only kept peace for our own country, but we\\'ve been able to extend the benefits of peace to others. In the Middle East, we\\'ve worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability. This is a very good step forward for our Nation\\'s security, and we\\'ll continue to do as we\\'ve done in the past.\\n\\nI might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature. There are always troublespots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President, alone in that Oval Office, affects our Nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests. That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently by every President who serves. That\\'s what I\\'ve tried to do, successfully, by keeping our country at peace.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Mr. Stone, do you have a followup on ‚Äî\\n\\nMR. STONE. Yes. I would like to be a little more specific on the use of military power, and let\\'s talk about one area for a moment.\\n\\nUnder what circumstances would you use military forces to deal with, for example, a shutoff of Persian Oil Gulf, if that should occur, or to counter Russian expansion beyond Afghanistan into either Iran or Pakistan? I ask this question in view of charges that we are woefully unprepared to project sustained ‚Äî and I emphasize the word \"sustained\" ‚Äî power in that part of the world.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Mr. Stone, in my State of the Union address earlier this year, I pointed out that any threat to the stability or security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country. In the past, we\\'ve not had an adequate military presence in that region. Now we have two major carrier task forces. We have access to facilities in five different areas of that region. And we\\'ve made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.\\n\\nBut in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our Nation be felt in a beneficial way. This, I believe, has assured that our interests will be protected in the Persian Gulf region, as we\\'ve done in the Middle East and throughout the world.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, you have a minute to comment or rebut.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, yes, I question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous administrations, in the preceding 8 years to this administration. I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those 8 years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace. I also would like to point out that Republican Presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both Houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.\\n\\nNow, Gerald Ford left a 5-year projected plan for a military buildup to restore our defenses, and President Garter\\'s administration reduced that by 38 percent, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the B-1, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missiles, delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world ‚Äî which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one that is quick to look for use of force.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter, you have the last word on this question.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Well, there are various elements of defense. One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope we\\'ll get to later on, because that\\'s the most important single issue in this campaign. Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world. I think, habitually, Governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas, when I and my predecessors both Democrats and Republicans ‚Äî have advocated resolving those troubles and those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation.\\n\\nIn addition to that, the buildup of military forces is good for our country, because we\\'ve got to have military strength in order to preserve the peace. But I\\'ll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle. Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Thank you, gentlemen. The next question is from Harry Ellis to President Carter.\\n\\nTHE NATION\\'S ECONOMY\\n\\nMR. ELLIS. Mr. President, when you were elected in 1976, the Consumer Price Index stood at 4.8 percent. It now stands at more than 12 percent. Perhaps more significantly, the Nation\\'s broader, underlying inflation rate has gone up from 7 to 9 percent. Now, a part of that was due to external factors beyond U.S. control, notably the more than doubling of oil prices by OPEC last year.\\n\\nBecause the United States remains vulnerable to such external shocks, can inflation in fact be controlled? If so, what measures would you pursue in a second term?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Again it\\'s important to put the situation into perspective. In 1974 we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree. We had an even worse oil shock in 1979. In 1974 we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War. The recession that resulted this time was the briefest we\\'ve had since the Second World War.\\n\\nIn addition, we\\'ve brought down inflation. Earlier this year, the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure, brought about by the OPEC price increase. It averaged about 18 percent the first quarter of this year. The second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13 percent. The most recent figures, the last 3 months, or the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7 percent ‚Äî still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs ‚Äî 9 million new jobs in the last 3 1/2 years ‚Äî that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.\\n\\nI noticed that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30-percent inflation rate. And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal ‚Äî and I quote them, I think-was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this Nation.\\n\\nSo, our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature. So, to add 9 million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with the energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Mr. Ellis, do you have a followup question for Mr. Carter?\\n\\nMR. ELLIS. Yes, Mr. President. You have mentioned the creation of 9 million new jobs.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes.\\n\\nMR. ELLIS. At the same time, the unemployment rate still hangs high, as does the inflation rate. Now, I wonder, can you tell us what additional policies you would pursue in a second administration in order to try to bring down that inflation rate? And would it be an act of leadership to tell the American people they\\'re going to have to sacrifice to adopt a leaner lifestyle for some time to come?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes. We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and they\\'ve done very well. As a matter of fact, we\\'re importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago. We\\'ve had a 25-percent reduction since the first year I was in office. At the same time, as I said earlier, we have added about 9 million net new jobs in that period of time ‚Äî a record never before achieved.\\n\\nAlso, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One, conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well ‚Äî more coal this year than ever before in history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.\\n\\nThe new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs ‚Äî about a million in the next 2 years. And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people. This has already passed the House; now has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Now, the same question goes to Governor Reagan. Governor Reagan, would you like to have the question repeated?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes, please.\\n\\nMR. ELLIS. Governor Reagan, during the past 4 years, the Consumer Price Index has risen from 4.8 percent to currently over 12 percent. And perhaps more significantly, the Nation\\'s broader, underlying rate of inflation has gone up from 7 to 9 percent. Now, a part of that has been due to external factors beyond U.S. control, and notably, the more than doubling of OPEC oil prices last year, which leads me to ask you whether, since the United States remains vulnerable to such external shocks, can inflation in fact be controlled? If so, specifically what measures would you pursue?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country, that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it\\'s uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious, and it\\'s dangerous to say this to the people. When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8 percent, as you said. It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford. It is now running at 12.7 percent.\\n\\nPresident Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created. Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs. But that can\\'t hide the fact that there are 8 million men and women out of work in America today, and 2 million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months. Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation. And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18 percent.\\n\\nSince then, he has blamed to the people for inflation, OPEC, he\\'s blamed the Federal Reserve System, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less. We don\\'t have inflation because the people are living too well. We have inflation because the Government is living too well.\\n\\nAnd the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending. I see my time is running out here. I\\'ll have to get this down very fast.\\n\\nYes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of Government to the place that we have balanced budgets and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in. And my economic plan calls for that.\\n\\nThe President\\'s economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way. But we\\'ll have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. A followup, Mr. Ellis?\\n\\nMR. ELLIS. Yes, you have centered on cutting Government spending in what you have just said about your own policies. You have also said that you would increase defense spending. Specifically, where would you cut Government spending if you were to increase defense spending and also cut taxes, so that, presumably, Federal revenues would shrink?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform. I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in Government. As a matter of fact, one of the Secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it. We\\'ve had the General Accounting Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.\\n\\nWe have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made. I\\'m confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation, because I did it in California. And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned money to the people and reduced government spending.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Governor Reagan\\'s proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public. He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least $130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal.\\n\\nI noticed that his task force that\\'s working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in the Wall Street Journal this week. One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage. This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country which is typical of many Republican leaders in the past, but I think has been accentuated under Governor Reagan.\\n\\nIn California ‚Äî I\\'m surprised Governor Reagan brought this up ‚Äî he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that State under his administration. He more than doubled State spending while he was Governor ‚Äî 122-percent increase ‚Äî and had between a 20- and 30-percent increase in the number of employees ‚Äî\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Sorry to interrupt ‚Äî\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. ‚Äî in California.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. ‚Äî Mr. Carter.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Thank you, sir.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan has the last word on this question.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same 4 years. The size of government increased only onesixth in California of what it increased in proportion to population in Georgia.\\n\\nAnd the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President, why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way they\\'d like, and it isn\\'t inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?\\n\\nMR. SMITH. I wish that question need not be rhetorical, but it must be because we\\'ve run out of time on that. [Laughter] Now, the third question to Governor Reagan from William Hilliard.\\n\\nURBAN POLICIES\\n\\nMR. HILLIARD. Yes, Governor Reagan, the decline of our cities has been hastened by the continual rise in crime, strained race relations, the fall in the quality of public education, the persistence of abnormal poverty in a rich nation, and a decline in the services to the public. The signs seem to point toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment of a permanent underclass in the cities. What, specifically, would you do in the next 4 years to reverse this trend?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner-city areas, that in cooperation with local government and with National Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperation with the private sector, that we have development zones. Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area. And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.\\n\\nThe elements of government through these tax incentives for example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldn\\'t be any loss to the city, because the city isn\\'t getting any tax from that now. And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people that would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government, and it wouldn\\'t hurt to give them a tax incentive, because that wouldn\\'t be costing Government anything either.\\n\\nI think there are things to do in this regard. I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977. You have to see it to believe it. It looks like a bombed-out city ‚Äî great, gaunt skeletons of buildings, windows smashed out, painted on one of them \"Unkept promises,\" on another, \"Despair.\" And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this area. There are whole blocks of land that are left bare, just bulldozed down flat, and nothing has been done. And they are now charging to take tourists through there to see this terrible desolation.\\n\\nI talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: \"Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again? Nothing has been done.\"\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Follow-up, Mr. Hilliard?\\n\\nMR. HILLIARD. Yes, Governor Reagan. Blacks and other nonwhites are increasing in numbers in our cities. Many of them feel that they are facing a hostility from whites that prevents them from joining the economic mainstream of our society. There is racial confrontation in the schools, on jobs, and in housing, as nonwhites seek to reap the benefits of a free society. What do you think is the Nation\\'s future as a multiracial society?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. I believe in it. I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that we\\'ve made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn\\'t even know it had a racial problem. I know those things can grow out of despair in an inner city, when there\\'s hopelessness at home, lack of work, and so forth. But I believe that all of us together ‚Äî and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was; it\\'s a bully pulpit ‚Äî and I think that something can be done from there, because the goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us ‚Äî ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be ‚Äî that we will have total equal opportunity for all people. And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Mr. Hilliard, would you repeat your question for President Carter?\\n\\nMR. HILLIARD. President Carter, the decline of our cities has been hastened by the continual rise in crime, strained race relations, the fall in the quality of public education, the persistence of abnormal poverty in a rich nation, and a decline in services to the public. The signs seem to point toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment of a permanent underclass in the cities. What, specifically, would you do in the next 4 years to reverse this trend?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Thank you, Mr. Hilliard.\\n\\nWhen I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our Nation. We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the Governors, and other interested officials. This has been a very successful effort. That\\'s one of the main reasons that we\\'ve had such an increase in the number of people employed. Of the 9 million people put to work in new jobs since I\\'ve been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans and another million among those who speak Spanish.\\n\\nWe now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit. Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country. We also are pursuing housing programs. We\\'ve had a 73-percent increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education. These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that had been deteriorating so rapidly in the past.\\n\\nIt\\'s very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens. I\\'ve brought into the top levels of Government ‚Äî into the White House, into administrative offices of the executive branch, into the judicial system ‚Äî highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded.\\n\\nI noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a younger man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country. Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem. We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. A followup question?\\n\\nMR. HILLIARD. Yes, President Carter, I\\'d like to repeat the same followup to you. Blacks and other nonwhites are increasing in numbers in our cities. Many of them feel that they are facing a hostility from whites that prevents them from joining the economic mainstream of our society. There is racial confrontation in the schools, on jobs, and in housing, as nonwhites seek to reap the benefits of a free society. What is your assessment of the Nation\\'s future in a multiracial society?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Ours is a nation of refugees, a nation of immigrants. Almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes, which are being realized, for a better life, preserving their ethnic commitments, their family structures, their religious beliefs, preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries, but still forming themselves together in a very coherent society, which gives our Nation its strength.\\n\\nIn the past, those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government. Since I\\'ve been President, I\\'ve appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous Presidents in the history of this country. I\\'ve done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans. To involve them in administration of government and a feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, you have a minute for rebuttal.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place. But as Governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end. They were public employment for these people who really want to get out into the private job market, where there are jobs with a future.\\n\\nNow, the President spoke a moment ago about ‚Äî that I was against the minimum wage. I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get. And indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people. And therefore, I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them.\\n\\nWith regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56 percent.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Garter, you have the last word on this question.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Well, it\\'s obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life. We have made good progress, and there\\'s no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, welfare, national health insurance, those kinds of commitments that have typified the Democratic Party since ancient history in this country\\'s political life are a very important element of the future. In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them, which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life. This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.\\n\\nThere is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown, central cities, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel-efficient, with a chance for a synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Thank you, gentlemen.\\n\\nNow for the fourth question, to President Garter from Barbara Walters.\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL TERRORISM\\n\\nMS. WALTERS. Mr. President, the eyes of the country tonight are on the hostages in Iran. I realize this is a sensitive area, but the question of how we respond to acts of terrorism goes beyond this current crisis. Other countries have policies that determine how they will respond. Israel, for example, considers hostages like soldiers and will not negotiate with terrorists.\\n\\nFor the future, Mr. President, the country has the right to know, do you have a policy for dealing with terrorism wherever it might happen, and what have we learned from this experience in Iran that might cause us to do things differently if this or something similar happens again?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists. At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the We. stern world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism. Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment. There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years, in recent months, additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.\\n\\nUltimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons. Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons in countries like Libya or Iraq. We have even alienated some of our closest trade partners, because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries.\\n\\nWhen Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes a very disturbing comment that nonproliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business. And when he was asked specifically, recently, about Iraq, he said there\\'s nothing we can do about it.\\n\\nThis ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it\\'s part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Ms. Walters, a followup?\\n\\nMS. WALTERS. Yes. While we are discussing policy, had Iran not taken American hostages, I assume that, in order to preserve our neutrality, we would have stopped the flow of spare parts and vital war materiels once war broke out between Iraq and Iran. Now, we\\'re offering to lift the ban on such goods if they let our people come home. Doesn\\'t this reward terrorism, compromise our neutrality, and possibly antagonize nations now friendly to us in the Middle East?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war. We have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to Iran that might be of a warlike nature. When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then and have consistently maintained since then that if the hostages are released safely, that we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns, which they have bought and paid for-also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released. That\\'s been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Would you repeat the question now for Governor Reagan, please, Ms. Walters?\\n\\nMs. WALTERS. Yes. Governor, the eyes of the country tonight remain on the hostages in Iran, but the question of how we respond to acts of terrorism goes beyond this current crisis. There are other countries that have policies that determine how they will respond. Israel, for example, considers hostages like soldiers and will not negotiate with terrorists.\\n\\nFor the future, the country has the right to know, do you have a policy for dealing with terrorism wherever it might happen, and what have we learned from this experience in Iran that might cause us to do things differently if this, or something similar, should happen again?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, Barbara, you\\'ve asked that question twice. I think you ought to have at least one answer to it. [Laughter]\\n\\nI have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages. Now, this comes from an answer that I\\'ve made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press. The question would be, \"Have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there?\" And I said, well, yes. And I think that anyone that\\'s seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, \"What about this, what about that?\" These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, in which I would know all the options that were open to me. I have never answered the question, however. Second ‚Äî the one that says, \"Well, tell me, what are some of those ideas?\" First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages. And sometimes, I think some of my ideas might involve quiet diplomacy, where you don\\'t say in advance or say to anyone what it is you\\'re thinking of doing.\\n\\nYour question is difficult to answer, because, in the situation right now, no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay, in any way, the return of those hostages if there is a chance of their coming home soon, or that might cause them harm.\\n\\nWhat I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families and that tragedy is over ‚Äî and we\\'ve endured this humiliation for just lacking 1 week of a year now ‚Äî then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they come home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about, what arrangements were made? And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I\\'m going to continue praying that they\\'ll come home.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Follow-up question.\\n\\nMs. WALTERS. Well, I would like to say that neither candidate answered specifically the question of a specific policy for dealing with terrorism, but I will ask Governor Reagan a different followup question. You have suggested that there would be no Iranian crisis had you been President, because we would have given firmer support to the Shah. But Iran is a country of 37 million people who were resisting a government they regarded as dictatorial.\\n\\nMy question is not whether the Shah\\'s regime was preferable to the Ayatollah\\'s, but whether the United States has the power or the right to try to determine what form of government any country will have, and do we back unpopular regimes whose major merit is that they are friendly to the United States?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism ‚Äî totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people. And we\\'ve been guilty of that. Because someone didn\\'t meet exactly our standards of human rights, even though they were an ally of ours, instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways, we have, in a number of instances, aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism, instead, for those people. And I think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy when, at the same time, we\\'re maintaining a detente with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all ‚Äî the Soviet Union.\\n\\nNow, there was a second phase in the Iranian affair in which we had something to do with that. And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our Embassy, and we could have done what other Embassies did ‚Äî either strengthen our security there or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor, I\\'m sorry, I must interrupt. President Carter, you have a minute for rebuttal.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. I didn\\'t hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or to reduce terrorism in the future. What the Western allies did decide to do is to stop all air flights-commercial air flights ‚Äî to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of airplanes, or the harboring of hijackers. Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office, not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives. Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities. And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel\\'s right to exist and recognizes U.N. Resolution 242 as a basis for a Middle East peace.\\n\\nThese are a few of the things to which our Nation is committed, and we will continue with these commitments.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, you have the last word on that question.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind. And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President. I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation, and nuclear proliferation, or the trying to halt it, would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine.\\n\\nMr. SMITH. Thank you, gentlemen. That is the first half of the debate.\\n\\nNow, the rules for the second half, quite simple. They\\'re only complicated when I explain them. [Laughter] In the second half, the panelists with me will have no followup questions. Instead, after the panelists have asked a question the candidates have answered, each of the candidates will have two opportunities to follow up, to question, to rebut, or just to comment on his opponent\\'s statement.\\n\\nGovernor Reagan will respond, in this section, to the first question from Marvin Stone.\\n\\nSTRATEGIC ARMS LIMITATION\\n\\nMr. STONE. Governor Reagan, arms control: The President said it was the single most important issue, Both of you have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms race with Russia, but by methods that are vastly different. You suggest that we scrap the SALT II treaty, already negotiated, and intensify the buildup of American power to induce the Soviets to sign a new treaty, one more favorable to us.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes.\\n\\nMR. STONE. President Carter, on the other hand, says he will again try to convince a reluctant Congress to ratify the present treaty on the grounds it\\'s the best we can hope to get.\\n\\nNow, both of you cannot be right. Will you tell us why you think you are?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. I think I\\'m right, because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy. And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet buildup, which has been going forward at a rapid pace and for quite some time.\\n\\nThe SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter\\'s team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons, and his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite yet. But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-1 bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done. The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever.\\n\\nNow, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest that I have. It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority. Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with 7 abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States-besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal. And we\\'re not equal in this treaty for one reason alone: Our B-52 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor, I have to interrupt you at that point. The time is up for that. But the same question now to President Carter.\\n\\nMR. STONE. Yes, President Carter. Both of you have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms race with Russia, but through vastly different methods. The Governor suggests we scrap the SALT II treaty, which you signed in Vienna ‚Äî intensify the buildup of American power to induce the Soviets to sign a new treaty, one more favorable to us. You, on the other hand, say you will again try to convince a reluctant Congress to ratify the present treaty on the grounds it is the best we can hope to get from the Russians.\\n\\nYou cannot both be right. Will you tell us why you think you are?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes, I\\'d be glad to. Inflation, unemployment, the cities-all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons. Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons, to negotiate with the Soviet Union ‚Äî balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry.\\n\\nThere is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan. He has never supported any of those arms control agreements ‚Äî the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the antiballistic missile treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford ‚Äî and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a 7-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.\\n\\nThe Senate has not voted yet on the strategic arms limitation treaty. There have been preliminary skirmishings in the committees of the Senate, but the treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote. It\\'s understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement. You\\'ve got 99 other Senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake. But when a man who hopes to be President says, \"Take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation\" ‚Äî that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, you have an opportunity to rebut that.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes, I\\'d like to respond very much.\\n\\nFirst of all, the Soviet Union ‚Äî if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it\\'s because we\\'ve been outnegotiated for quite a long time. And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military buildup in the history of man.\\n\\nNow, to suggest that because two Republican Presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty ‚Äî that puts them on its side ‚Äî I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90 percent of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty. I would like to point out also that Senators like Henry Jackson and Hollings of South Carolina ‚Äî they are taking the lead in the fight against this particular treaty.\\n\\nI am not talking of scrapping; I am talking of taking the treaty back and going back into negotiations. And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other. That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes. Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements. He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty ‚Äî and I don\\'t know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form ‚Äî but he also advocates the possibility-he said it\\'s been a missing element-of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race and insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own Nation as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.\\n\\nIf President Brezhnev said, \"We will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American presidents over a 7-year period of time; we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations; and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations,\" it\\'s obvious that I, as President, and all Americans would reject such a proposition. This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race.\\n\\nIt would be very disturbing to American people. It would change the basic tone and commitment that our Nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with all Presidents, Democratic and Republican, and would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty. In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.\\n\\nThis attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it\\'s said with a quiet voice.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. I know the President\\'s supposed to be replying to me, but sometimes, I have a hard time in connecting what he\\'s saying with what I have said or what my positions are. I sometimes think he\\'s like the witch doctor that gets mad when a good doctor comes along with a cure that\\'ll work.\\n\\nMy point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating. It does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States; it calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other. And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true. It was a new negotiation, because, as I say, President Ford was within about 10 percent of having a solution that could be acceptable. And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter, you have the last word on this question.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. I think, to close out this discussion, it would be better to put into perspective what we\\'re talking about.\\n\\nI had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was. She said she thought nuclear weaponry and the control of nuclear arms.\\n\\nThis is a formidable force. Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion. If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a trainload of TNT stretching across this Nation. That\\'s one major war explosion in a warhead. We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads. The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President, and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. We have to go to another question now, from Harry Ellis to President Carter.\\n\\nENERGY\\n\\nMR. ELLIS. Mr. President, as you have said, Americans, through conservation, are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago. Yet U.S. dependence on Arab oil as a percentage of total imports is today much higher than it was at the time of the 1973 Arab oil embargo. And for some time to come, the loss of substantial amounts of Arab oil could plunge the U.S. into depression. Now, this means that a bridge must be built out of this dependence.\\n\\nCan the United States develop synthetic fuels and other alternative energy sources without damage to the environment, and will this process mean steadily higher fuel bills for American families?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. I don\\'t think there\\'s any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up. What I\\'ve had as a basic commitment since I\\'ve been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil: It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy, to stop the waste of energy, and secondly, to produce more American energy.\\n\\nWe\\'ve been very successful in both cases. We\\'ve now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by onethird. We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same day just a year ago.\\n\\nThis commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our Nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the conventional kinds of American energy. We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history. We\\'ll produce more coal this year than any year in history. We\\'re exporting more coal this year than any year in history. And we have an opportunity now, with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on the world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source.\\n\\nThis exciting future will not only give us more energy security but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we\\'ve put into effect.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Would you repeat the question now for Governor Reagan?\\n\\nMR. ELLIS. Governor Reagan, Americans, through conservation, are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago. And yet, U.S. reliance on Arab oil as a percentage of total imports is much higher today than it was during the 1973 Arab oil embargo. And the substantial loss of Arab oil could plunge the United States into depression.\\n\\nThe question is whether the development of alternative energy sources, in order to reduce this dependence, can be done without damaging the environment, and will it mean for American families steadily higher fuel bills?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. I\\'m not sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this Nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich. The coal that the President mentioned: Yes, we have it, and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now. The mines are closed down; there are 22,000 miners out of work. Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it. With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act. I think, as technology improves, we\\'ll be able to do even better with that.\\n\\nThe other thing is that we have only leased out and begun to explore 2 percent of our Outer Continental Shelf for oil, where it is believed by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy that there are vast supplies yet to be found. Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were ‚Äî well, they were public lands subject to multiple-use exploration for minerals and so forth. It is believed that probably 70 percent of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there. This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska.\\n\\nNuclear power: There were 36 powerplants planned in this country ‚Äî and let me add the word \"safety\"; it must be done with the utmost of safety. But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits and so forth make it take more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.\\n\\nWe have the sources here. We are energy-rich, and coal is one of the great potentials we have.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter, your comment?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes, sir. To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we\\'ll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal ‚Äî an unequaled record in the history of our country. Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations ‚Äî regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality of our water and our land. We cannot cast aside those regulations. We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce.\\n\\nGovernor Reagan\\'s approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal or to change substantially the windfall profits tax, to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies, to do away with the Department of Energy, to shortcircuit our synthetic fuels program, to put a minimal emphasis on solar power, to emphasize strongly nuclear powerplants as a major source of energy in the future. He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. That is a misstatement, of course, of my position. I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than Government can. The Department of Energy has a multibillion-dollar budget, in excess of $10 billion. It hasn\\'t produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal or anything else in the line of energy.\\n\\nAnd for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth as Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States ‚Äî the strictest air quality law that has ever been adopted in the United States. And we created an OSHA, an occupational safety and health agency, for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place. And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged.\\n\\nSo, I think some of those charges are missing the point. I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation. And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter, another crack at that?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Sure. As a matter of fact, the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well known fact. Also, recently, when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished, Governor Reagan responded, \"Amen.\"\\n\\nThe offshore drilling rights is a question that Governor Reagan raises often. As a matter of fact, in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation, 100 percent of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration, and 95 percent of all the Alaska lands where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist. We have, with our 5-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.\\n\\nSo, we\\'re not putting restraints on American exploration; we\\'re encouraging it in every way we can.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, you have the last word on this question.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. If it is a wellknown fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California ‚Äî not a law, regulations that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations. It would have destroyed the economy of California, and, I must say, we had the support of Congress when pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency. We still have the strictest air control or air pollution laws in the country.\\n\\nAs for offshore oiling, only 2 percent now is so leased and is producing oil. The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next 5 years or so ‚Äî we\\'re already 5 years behind in what we should be doing. There is more oil now in the wells that have been drilled than has been taken out in the 121 years that they\\'ve been drilled.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Thank you, Governor.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nThe next question goes to Governor Reagan from William Hilliard.\\n\\nSOCIAL SECURITY\\n\\nMR. HILLIARD. Governor Reagan, wage earners in this country ‚Äî especially the young ‚Äî are supporting a social security system that continues to affect their income drastically. The system is fostering a struggle between the young and the old, and is drifting the country toward a polarization of these two groups. How much longer can the young wage earner expect to bear the ever-increasing burden of the social security system?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. The social security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase. It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then. Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our Nation\\'s history, the payroll tax increase for social security, which will only put a Band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.\\n\\nWhat is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on social security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check. We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens, leave them thinking that in some way they\\'re endangered and they would have no place to turn. They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis. But it\\'s going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the roof fall in on the next administration.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Would you repeat that question for President Carter?\\n\\nMR. HILLIARD. Yes, President Carter. Wage earners in this country, especially the young, are supporting a social security system that continues to affect their income drastically. The system is fostering a struggle between young and old and is drifting the country toward a polarization of these two groups. How much longer can the young wage earner expect to bear the ever-increasing burden of the social security system?\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. As long as there\\'s a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable social security system, free of the threat of bankruptcy. Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions he has advocated making social security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it. I noticed also in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making social security more sound by reducing the adjustments in social security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation. These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security and the well-being, and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.\\n\\nBut no matter what it takes in the future to keep social security sound, it must be kept that way. And although there was a serious threat to the social security system and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress, working with me, has been to put social security back on a sound financial basis. That\\'s the way it will stay.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, that just isn\\'t true. It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes. And I don\\'t believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they\\'re paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out.\\n\\nNow, again this statement that somehow I wanted to destroy it, and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary social security, which would mean the ruin of it. Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that a young man, orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for social security insurance, because she was not his mother. And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who\\'s paying in should be able to name his own beneficiaries. And that\\'s the closest I\\'ve ever come to anything voluntary with social security. I, too, am pledged to a social security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours they\\'re going to continue to get their money.\\n\\nThem are some changes I\\'d like to make. I would like to make a change that discriminates in the regulations against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her husband\\'s benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get. I\\'d like to change that.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter\\'s rebuttal now.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Fine. These constant suggestions that the basic social security system should be changed does cause concern and consternation among the aged of our country. It\\'s obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that social security benefits should not be taxed, and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which social security payments are made to the retired people. We also need to continue to index the social security payments so that if inflation rises, the social security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of the social security check continue intact.\\n\\nIn the past, the relationship between social security and Medicare has been very important to provide some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits. Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this Nation against Medicare. Now we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease; an emphasis on outpatient care, not inpatient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care for those who are ill; an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it. These are the kind of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people. Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. There you go again. [Laughter]\\n\\nWhen I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress. I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed. I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them. I was opposing one piece of legislation as versus another.\\n\\nThere is something else about social security ‚Äî of course, that doesn\\'t come out of the payroll tax; it comes out of the general fund ‚Äî that something should be done about. I think it\\'s disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in social security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from social security every month while a State institution provides for all of their needs and their care.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter, you have the last word on this question.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. I think this debate on social security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies as vividly as any other subject tonight the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation. These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this Nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.\\n\\nI noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic Presidents, in his acceptance address and otherwise. I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican President, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans. So, its good for the American people to remember there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues-also, between the two parties that we represent.\\n\\n√Ç MR. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. President, Governor Reagan.\\n\\n√Ç We now go to another question, a question to President Carter by Barbara Walters.\\n\\nASSESSMENTS OF OPPONENT\\n\\nMS. WALTERS. Thank you.\\n\\nYou have addressed some of the major issues tonight, but the biggest issue in the minds of American voters is yourselves, your ability to lead this country. When many voters go into that booth just a week from today, they will be voting their gut instinct about you men.\\n\\nYou\\'ve already given us your reasons why people should vote for you. Now would you please tell us for this your final question, why they should not vote for your opponent, why his Presidency could be harmful to the Nation and, having examined both your opponent\\'s record and the man himself, tell us his greatest weakness.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question. [Laughter]\\n\\nFirst of all, there\\'s the historical perspective that I just described. This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I\\'ve taken in the Oval Office the last 4 years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others. The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations that don\\'t presently have it, particularly the terrorist nations.\\n\\nThe inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he\\'s been running for President ‚Äî I think since 1968 ‚Äî to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America ‚Äî this is typical of his longstanding inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it.\\n\\nObviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war. But a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way, in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Barbara, would you repeat the question for Governor Reagan?\\n\\nMS. WALTERS. Yes, thank you. Realizing that you may be equally reluctant to speak ill of your opponent, may I ask why people should not vote for your opponent, why his Presidency could be harmful to the Nation? And having examined both your opponent\\'s record and the man himself, could you tell us his greatest weakness?\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference-and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight ‚Äî that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program. I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers and autonomy and authority that belongs back at the State and local level ‚Äî it has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people ‚Äî and that there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them.\\n\\nNow, as to why I should be and he shouldn\\'t be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index. He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5 under President Ford. And he said that no man with that size misery index had a right to seek reelection to the Presidency. Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20 percent, and I think this must suggest something.\\n\\nBut when I have quoted a Democrat President, as the President says, I was a Democrat. I said many foolish things back in those days. [Laughter] But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democrat promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept. And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today. And that\\'s why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept. It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes. I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals or historical perspective of his own party. I don\\'t think this can be better illustrated than in the case with guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our Nation. For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment. Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women\\'s rights. Governor Reagan and the new Republican Party has departed from this commitment ‚Äî a very severe blow to the opportunity for women finally to correct discrimination under which they have suffered.\\n\\nWhen a man and a woman do the same amount of work, a man gets paid a dollar; a woman only gets paid 59 cents. And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for women by the Federal Government or by the State governments. That\\'s all it says ‚Äî a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic Party and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan\\'s radical departure from the longstanding policy of his own party.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes. Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands of unelected judges. I am for equal rights, and while you have been in office for 4 years, and not one single State ‚Äî and most of them have a majority of Democratic legislators has added to the ratification or voted to ratify the equal rights amendment.\\n\\nWhile I was Governor, more than 8 years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned, equal pay and so forth. I believe that if in all these years that we\\'ve spent trying to get the amendment, that we\\'d spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California ‚Äî and we were the first to do it.\\n\\nIf I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment. I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we\\'d start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. President Carter.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes. Howard, I\\'m a southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region about an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system. One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country. We\\'ve been remarkably successful, with the help of the Democratic Congress. We\\'ve deregulated the air industry, the rail industry, the trucking industry, financial institutions; now working on the communications industry.\\n\\nIn addition to that, I believe this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected ‚Äî not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living ‚Äî because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps since the long Depression years and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country. We\\'ve made remarkable success. It\\'s part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.\\n\\nSo, my heritage as a southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I\\'ve just described is a proper course for the future.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan, yours is the last word.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Well, my last word is again to say that we were talking about this very simple amendment and women\\'s rights. And I make it plain again: I am for women\\'s rights. But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that so-called simple amendment could be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women, respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against doing things that would be physically harmful to them. Those could all be challenged by men. And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.\\n\\nI thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on. But, if we\\'re talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, I\\'m the only fellow that ever ran for this job who was six times president of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Gentlemen, each of you now have 3 minutes for a closing statement. President Carter, you\\'re first.\\n\\nCLOSING STATEMENTS\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT. First of all, I\\'d like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible. I think it\\'s been a very constructive debate, and I hope it\\'s helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan. Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during this last few hours in my life.\\n\\nI\\'ve been President now for almost 4 years. I\\'ve had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process. I\\'ve seen the strength of my Nation, and I\\'ve seen the crises that it approached in a tentative way. And I\\'ve had to deal with those crises as best I could.\\n\\nAs I\\'ve studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I\\'ve been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us. I think the results of this debate indicate that that fact is true. I consider myself in the mainstream of my party. I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who\\'ve served before me. The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure. We must have a society that\\'s just and fair. And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world.\\n\\nI believe that since I\\'ve been in office, there\\'ve been six or eight areas of combat evolve in other parts of the world. In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country. I\\'ve done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts. But I\\'ve learned in this last 3 1/2 years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50. And the final judgment about the future of our Nation ‚Äî war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern ‚Äî has to be made by the man in the Oval Office. It\\'s a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open government, the job is a very gratifying one.\\n\\nThe American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision. Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country. And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference. If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this Nation. And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not.\\n\\nThere is a partnership involved. And our Nation, to stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in all other nations is my plan for the future. I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Governor Reagan.\\n\\nGOVERNOR REAGAN. Yes, I would like to add my words of thanks, too, to the ladies of the League of Women Voters for making these debates possible. I\\'m sorry that we couldn\\'t persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates. But still, it\\'s good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country.\\n\\nNext Tuesday is election day. Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls; you\\'ll stand there in the polling place and make a decision. I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were 4 years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was 4 years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was 4 years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we\\'re as strong as we were 4 years ago? And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to who you\\'ll vote for. If you don\\'t agree, if you don\\'t think that this course that we\\'ve been on for the last 4 years is what you would like to see us follow for the next 4, then I could suggest another choice that you have.\\n\\nThis country doesn\\'t have to be in the shape that it is in. We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity, with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing. We talk about the unemployment lines. If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing 2 feet for each one of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California. All of this can be cured, and all of it can be solved.\\n\\nI have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous State in the Union if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world-I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make. I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this Nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today. I know because we did it there. We cut the cost ‚Äî the increased cost of government-the increase in half over the 8 years. We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits, and cuts to our people. We, as I\\'ve said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that. And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people.\\n\\nI would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help. And it would be one to take government off the backs of the great people of this country and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nMR. SMITH. Gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, for 60 years the League of Women Voters has been committed to citizen education and effective participation of Americans in governmental and political affairs. The most critical element of all in that process is an informed citizen who goes to the polls and who votes.\\n\\nOn behalf of the League of Women Voters, now, I would like to thank President Carter and Governor Reagan for being with us in Cleveland tonight. And, ladies and gentlemen, thank you and good night.'}]\n"

      "I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think that's all wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we've seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I don't believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we've got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "DUKAKIS: I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've been dealing with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're providing that young woman with help.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Values begin at the top, in the White House.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.\n",
      "\n",
      "LEHRER: Governor, a follow-up question.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have two minutes to answer it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you suggesting, sir, that President Reagan is one of the causes of the drug problem in this country?\n",
      "\n",
      "DUKAKIS: I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we also have to take demand seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're helping youngsters; we're reaching out to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "LEHRER: A minute to rebut, Mr. Vice President.\n",
      "\n",
      "BUSH: Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked for and received the same briefing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what I'm about to say is unclassified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so I think it's about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Panama is a friendly country.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we want to bring him to justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "LEHRER: All right, the next question will be asked by John Mashek.\n",
      "\n",
      "It goes to Governor Dukakis, and you'll have two minutes to answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "MASHEK: Governor Dukakis, another troublesome issue for voters this year is the bulging federal deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a Dukakis administration, you say taxes will be raised only as a last resort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you identify for us then please three specific programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down?\n",
      "\n",
      "DUKAKIS: Yes, I've been very specific about those, John.\n",
      "\n",
      "And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I've outlined those in detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, finally, we've got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid to this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing I don't understand about Mr. Bush's approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes, although he's broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Laughter)\n",
      "\n",
      "DUKAKIS: But I hope you won't take my five seconds away from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will say this -\n",
      "\n",
      "LEHRER: Your two minutes is up, Governor.\n",
      "\n",
      "DUKAKIS: If he's serious about what he's saying, then the only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the Social Security Trust Fund, and he tried that in 1985, and I think he's going to try it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "LEHRER: You have a minute to rebut.\n",
      "\n",
      "BUSH: Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?\n",
      "\n",
      "That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Laughter)\n",
      "\n",
      "BUSH: Let me help the governor.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are so many things there, I don't quite know where to begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not going to cost the government money.\n",

      "JENNINGS: Well, Governor, and Vice President Bush, you've both talked tonight about hard choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try to give you one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somewhere in the Middle East tonight, nine Americans are being held hostage.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are commander-in-chief and Americans are held hostage, what will be more important to you, their individual fate, or the commitment that the United States Government must never negotiate with terrorists.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if any Americans are held hostage and you become president, to what lengths would you go to rescue them?\n",
      "\n",
      "DUKAKIS: Peter, it's one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are American citizens, we care deeply about them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their families care deeply about them, want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do it's an open invitation to others to do the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got to be tough on international terrorism.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got to treat it as international crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got to attack at all points, we've go to use undercover operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.\n",

      "\n",
      "Elected officials have played along by promising to cure inflation while backing away from tough programs that might hurt one special interest group or another, and by actually adding inflationary elements to the system, such as indexing.\n",

      "\n",
      "REP. JOHN B. ANDERSON: Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we've got to have fiscal restraint.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees.\n",
      "\n",
      "That we ought to ... in addition to that, we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year, rather than twice a year, and save $750 billion.\n",

      "\n",
      "LOOMIS: Governor Reagan, repeating the question, and I would ask you, again, to engage in as many specifics as you possibly can.\n",

      "What politically unpopular measures are you willing to endorse, push and stay with that might provide real progress in reducing inflation?\n",

      "\n",
      "RONALD REAGAN: I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those.\n",
      "\n",
      "perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you're causing inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it isn't really higher prices, it's just, you are reducing the value of the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are robbing the American people of their savings.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, the plan that I have proposed - and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology - all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations - produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections.\n",
      "\n",
      "conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "MOYERS: Your time is up.\n",
      "\n",
      "REAGAN: ...and $500 billion over the next five.\n",

      "\n",
      "ANDERSON: Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline.\n",
      "\n",
      "I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that.\n",
      "\n",
      "those imports have been reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas I have proposed we ought to take.\n",
      "\n",
      "put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "their Social Security tax payments by 50%.\n",

      "MOYERS: Mr. Reagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "REAGAN: Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then we're asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers.\n",

      "or 15 months ago, on what he believed in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.\n",

      "\n",
      "My question for the Governor is: Every serious examination of the future supply of energy and other essential resources - including air, land and water - finds that we face shortages and skyrocketing prices, and that, in many ways, we're pushing the environment to dangerous limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to know, specifically, what changes you would encourage and require in American lifestyles in automobile use, housing, land use and general consumption, to meet problems that aren't going to respond to campaign lullabies about minor conservation efforts and more production?\n",
      "\n",
      "REAGAN: Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is known oil reserves, known supplies.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.\n",

      "\n",
      "ANDERSON: Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really.\n",
      "\n",
      "all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people.\n",
      "\n",
      "and that's simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at the same time, I think it's going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile.\n",
      "\n",
      "We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today.\n",

      "\n",
      "When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9.\n",

      "But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.\n",
      "\n",
      "And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time.\n",

      "\n",
      "And I think the first question is over here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign Trade and Domestic Jobs\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. I'd like to direct my question to Mr. Perot.\n",
      "\n",
      "What will you do as President to open foreign markets to fair competition from American business and to stop unfair competition here at home from foreign countries so that we can bring jobs back to the United States?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Perot.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's right at the top of my agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've shipped millions of jobs overseas, and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while, you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on Presidential campaigns, make sure you got good contacts, and then go back out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if you just want to get down to brass tacks, first thing you ought to do is get all these folks that have got these one-way trade agreements that we've negotiated over the years and say, \"Fellas, we'll take the same deal we gave you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They'll gridlock right at that point, because, for example, we've got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships if they had to comply, you see, if it was a two-way street, just couldn't do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have got to stop sending jobs overseas.\n",
      "\n",
      "To those of you in the audience who are business people, pretty simple: If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay $1 an hour for labor, hire young -- let's assume you've been in business for a long time; you've got a mature work force -- pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care -- that's the most expensive single element in making a car -- have no environmental controls, no pollution controls, and no retirement, and you don't care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if the people send me to Washington, the first thing I'll do is study that 2,000-page agreement and make sure it's a two-way street.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have one last part here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided I was dumb and didn't understand it, so I called the \"Who's Who\" of the folks that have been around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I said, \"Why won't everybody go south?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They say, \"It would be disruptive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, \"For how long?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I finally got them up for 12 to 15 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I said, \"Well, how does it stop being disruptive?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And that is, when their jobs come up from $1 an hour to $6 an hour, and ours go down to $6 an hour, then it's leveled again.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the meantime, you've wrecked the country with these kinds of deals.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got to cut it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Simpson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. Perot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see that the President has stood up, so he must have something to say about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Bush.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Carole, the thing that saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our exports, and what I'm trying to do is increase our exports.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, indeed, all the jobs were going to move south because of lower wages, there are lower wages now, and they haven't done that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I have just negotiated with the President of Mexico the North American free trade agreement, and the Prime Minister of Canada, I might add.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to have more of these free trade agreements because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many.\n",
      "\n",
      "But any one that's here, we want to have more jobs here, and the way to do that is to increase our exports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some believe in protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe in free and fair trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the thing that saved us.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so I will keep on, as President, trying to get a successful conclusion to the GATT round, the big Uruguay round of trade which will really open up markets for our agriculture, particularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to get one with Eastern Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to get one with Chile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I say, we've had tough economic times, and it's exports that have saved us, exports that have built -- --\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Simpson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to answer the question, because I've actually been a Governor for 12 years, so I've known a lot of people who have lost their jobs because of jobs moving overseas, and I know a lot of people whose plants have been strengthened by increasing exports.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up, and our trade deficit's gone down.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also true that just today a record-high trade deficit was announced with Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what is the answer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me just mention three things very quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Number one, make sure that other countries are as open to our markets as our markets are to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "If they're not, have measures on the books that don't take forever and a day to implement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Number two, change the Tax Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are more deductions in the Tax Code for shutting plants down and moving overseas than there are for modernizing plants and equipment here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our competitors don't do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plants and equipment here, not moving plants overseas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Number three, stop the Federal Government's program that now gives low interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries, but we won't do the same thing for plants that stay here.\n",
      "\n",
      "So more trade, but on fair terms, and favor investment in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Simpson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we have a question over here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Federal Deficit\n",
      "\n",
      "Q.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is for Governor Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the real world, that is, outside of Washington, DC, compensation and achievement are based on goals defined and achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "My question is about the deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you define in specific dollar goals how much you would reduce the deficit in each of the 4 years of a Clinton administration and then enter into a legally binding contract with the American people that if you did not achieve those goals that you would not seek a second term?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer yes or no, and then comment on your answer, please.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, and here's why; I'll tell you exactly why, because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll tell you exactly what I think can be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we can bring it down by 50 percent in 4 years and grow the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you'd have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them, and it would even make the economy worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years, but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years.\n",
      "\n",
      "So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy, and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs, and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes, and investing in growing this economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nine Nobel Prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans, said this is the way you've got to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't grow the economy, you can't get it done.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a President should be judged solely on the deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me also say we're having an election today.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll have a shot at me in 4 years, and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would welcome you to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Simpson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President?\n",
      "\n",
      "President Bush.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I've got to -- I'm a little confused here because I don't see how you can grow the deficit down by raising people's taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "You see, I don't think the American people are taxed too little.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think they're taxed too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went for one tax increase, and when I make a mistake, I admit it, say that wasn't the right thing to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more: $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't believe that's the way to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's some things that will help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Give us a balanced budget amendment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget, and they do.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he has a balanced budget amendment; have to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like the Government to have that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to have what 43 Governors have, the line-item veto.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if the Congress can't cut, we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the President have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've proposed another one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some sophisticates think it may be a little gimmicky.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's good.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a check-off.\n",
      "\n",
      "It says to you as a taxpayer -- say, you're going to pay a tax of $1,000 or something; you can check 10 percent of that if you want to in one box, and that 10 percent, $100, or if you're paying $10,000, whatever it is, $1,000, check it off, and make the Government, make it lower the deficit by that amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Congress won't do it, if they can't get together and negotiate how to do that, then you'd have a sequester across the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'd exempt Social Security.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to tax or touch Social Security.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm the President that said, \"Hey, don't mess with Social Security.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And we haven't.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I believe we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman's question, that's the main growing thing in the budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "The program that the President -- two-thirds of the budget, I, as President, never get to look at, never get to touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just don't believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Simpson.\n",
      "\n",
      "How about you, Mr. Perot?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Perot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we're $4 trillion in debt, and we're going into debt an additional $1 billion, a little more than $1 billion, every working day of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the thing I love about it -- I'm just a businessman.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was down in Texas, taking care of business, tending to my family.\n",
      "\n",
      "This situation got so bad that I decided I had better get into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The American people asked me to get into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight, we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I'm looking for is who did it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, they're the two folks involved; so maybe if you put them together, they did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the facts are we have to fix it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy, I had multiple job offers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young people with high grades can't get a job.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, we were down to -- 18 percent of them were making -- the 18- to 24-year-olds were making less than $12,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that's up to 40 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what's happening in the meantime?\n",
      "\n",
      "The dollar's gone through the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, whose fault is that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not the Democrats; not the Republicans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somewhere out there there's an extraterrestrial that's doing this to us, I guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Laughter] And everybody says they take responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somebody, somewhere has to take responsibility for this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put it to you bluntly, the American people: If you want me to be your President, we're going to face our problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll deal with the problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll solve our problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll pay down our debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll pass on the American dream to our children.\n",

      "\n",
      "Today it will take 12 generations.\n",

      "\n",
      "You're all wonderful speakers, and I know you have lots more to add.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have talked to this audience, and they have lots of questions on other topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can we move to another topic, please?\n",

      "We have one up here, I think.\n",

      "Q.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I'd like to address all the candidates with this question.\n",

      "\n",
      "Who wants to take that one?\n",

      "Go right ahead, sir.\n",

      "[Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Perot.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, I don't have an answer for everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you all know, I've been buying 30-minute segments to talk about issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tomorrow night on NBC from 10:30 to 11, eastern, we're going to talk about how you pay the debt down.\n",

      "\n",
      "We'll be on again Saturday night 8 to 9 o'clock on ABC.\n",

      "\n",
      "Okay, okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Perot.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the point is, finally, I couldn't agree with you more, couldn't agree with you more.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I have said again and again and again, let's get off mud wrestling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's get off personalities, and let's talk about jobs, health care, crime, the things that concern the American people.\n",

      "Ms. Simpson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. Perot.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that seems directed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would say it's you gentlemen that have been doing that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Clinton, Governor Clinton, how do you -- President Bush, how would you like to respond?\n",
      "\n",
      "President Bush.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, first place, I believe that character is a part of being President.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you have to look at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that has to be a part of candidate for President or being President.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of programs, I've submitted, what, four different budgets to the United States Congress in great detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "They're so heavy they'd give you a broken back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything in there says what I am for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I've come out with a new agenda for America's renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "My record on world affairs is pretty well-known because I've been President for 4 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I feel I've been talking issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody likes \"who shot John,\" but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to stand up and say, \"Hey, listen, here's my side of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But character is an important part of the equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other night, Governor Clinton raised -- I don't know if you saw the debate the other night, suffered through that.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Laughter] Well, he raised a question of my father.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a good line, well-rehearsed and well-delivered.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he raised a question of my father and said, \"Well, your father, Prescott Bush, was against McCarthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "You should be ashamed of yourself -- McCarthyism.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember something my dad told me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was 18 years old, going to Penn Station to go into the Navy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, \"Write your mother,\" which I faithfully did.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, \"Serve your country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My father was an honor, duty, and country man.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he said, \"Tell the truth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And I've tried to do that in public life, all through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "That has said something about character.\n",
      "\n",
      "My argument with Governor Clinton -- you can call it mud wrestling, but I think it's fair to put it in focus -- is I am deeply troubled by someone who demonstrates and organizes demonstration in a foreign land when his country's at war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably a lot of kids here disagree with me, but that's what I feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's what I feel passionately about.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm thinking of Ross Perot's running mate sitting in the jail; how would he feel about it?\n",

      "\n",
      "So I am very proud of the way that came about, and I think it's a very, very good beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits.\n",
      "\n",
      "And $150 billion is a lot of money, but it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down.\n",

      "\n",
      "Our home initiative, our homeownership initiative, HOPE, that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our enterprise zones that we hear a lot of lip service about in Congress would bring jobs into the inner city.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a good program.\n",

      "When we went out to South Central in Los Angeles -- some of you may remember the riots there.\n",

      "I went out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to a boys club, and every one of them, the boys club leaders, the ministers, all of them were saying, pass enterprise zones.\n",
      "\n",
      "We go back to Washington, and very difficult to get it through the Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there's going to be a new Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one likes gridlock.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's going to be a new Congress because the old one, I don't want to get this man mad at me, but there was a post office scandal and a bank scandal.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're going to have a lot of new Members of Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then you can sit down and say, \"Help me do what we should for the cities.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ms. Simpson.\n",

      "Mr. President, aren't you threatening to veto the bill, the urban aid bill, that included enterprise zones?\n",
      "\n",
      "President Bush.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, but the problem is you get so many things included in a great big bill that you have to look at the overall good.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the problem with our system.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you had a line-item veto, you could knock out the pork.\n",

      "You could knock out the tax increases, and you could do what the people want, and that is create enterprise zones.\n",

      "Governor Clinton, you're chomping at the bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "That bill pays for these urban enterprise zones by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more, and that's why he wants to veto it, just like he vetoed an earlier bill this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not mud slinging.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is fact slinging.\n",

      "\n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Clinton.\n",

      "A bill earlier this year -- this is fact -- that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities and our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing.\n",

      "I agree with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, we agree with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me tell you specifically what my plan does: My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation, communications, environmental cleanup, and new technologies for the 21st century.\n",
      "\n",
      "We would target it especially in areas that have been either depressed or which have lost a lot of defense-related jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense-related jobs.\n",

      "They ought to be engaged in making high-speed rail.\n",
      "\n",
      "They ought to be engaged in breaking ground in other technologies, doing waste recycling, clean water technology, and things of that kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can create millions of jobs in these new technologies, more than we're going to lose in defense if we target it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we're investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our wealth growth is going down as a result of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's making the country poorer, which is why I answered the gentleman the way I did before.\n",

      "First, you've got to have money to pay for these things.\n",

      "I talked to the Republican leaders, and they want it.\n",

      "If they would talk to one another instead of throwing rocks, I think we could get a lot done.\n",
      "\n",
      "And among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee, to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, to the President who's anxious, I'd say, \"Rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart; try to get together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get the bill passed, and give the people the benefits, and not play party politics right now.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "That's the way I would do it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Gun Control and Crime\n",
      "\n",
      "Q.\n",
      "\n",
      "My question was originally for Governor Clinton, but I think I would welcome a response from all three candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you are aware, crime is rampant in our cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Richmond area, and I'm sure it's happened elsewhere, 12-year-olds are carrying guns to school.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'm sure when our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, they did not mean for the right to bear arms to apply to 12-year-olds.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I'm asking, where do you stand on gun control, and what do you plan to do about it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Simpson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Clinton?\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "I support the right to keep and bear arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "I live in a State where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses or both.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I believe we have to have some way of checking handguns before they're sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I support the Brady bill, which would impose a national waiting period, unless and until a State did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you automate your records, then you don't have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also think we should have, frankly, restrictions on assault weapons, whose only purpose is to kill.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third thing I would say doesn't bear directly on gun control, but it's very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need more police on the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly by Republican Senators.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's a shame it didn't pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it should be made the law, but it had the Brady bill in it, the waiting period.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirty years ago there were three police officers on the street for every crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, there are three crimes for every police officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, or on the same blocks, you've seen crime go down.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Houston there's been a 15-percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the Mayor did there in increasing the police force.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I know it can work.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've seen it happen.\n",

      "\n",
      "I talk about strengthening the American family.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's very hard to strengthen the family if people are scared to walk down to the corner store and send their kid down to get a loaf of bread.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's very hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been fighting for very strong anticrime legislation: habeas corpus reform, so you don't have these endless appeals; so when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule, so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn't go away.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll probably get into a fight in this room with some, but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virginia's in lead in this, as Governor Clinton properly said, on this identification system for firearms.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not for national registration of firearms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the States that have the toughest antigun laws have the highest levels of crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am for the right -- as the Governor says, I'm a sportsman, and I don't think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I was not for the bill that he was talking about because it was not tough enough on the criminal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas, endorsed me, because I think they see I'm trying to strengthen the anticrime legislation.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got more money going out for local police than any previous administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we've got to get it under control.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as one last point I'd make: drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're making some progress, doing a little better on interdiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're not doing as well amongst the people that get to be habitual drug users.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is, and I think it's true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine substantially, 60 percent in the last couple of years.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we're making progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "But until we get that one done, we're not going to solve the neighborhood crime problem.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Brady bill, I agree that it's a timid step in the right direction, but it won't fix it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So why pass a law that won't fix it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, what it really boils down to is can you live -- we have become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we have forgotten the rights of the innocent.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our country, we have evolved to a point where we've put millions of innocent people in jail, because you go to the poor neighborhoods and they've put bars on their windows and bars on their doors and put themselves in jail to protect the things that they acquired legitimately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that's where we are.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have got to become more concerned about people who play by the rules and get the balance we require.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is going to take, first, building a consensus in grassroots America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus, and then do it and then go on to the next one.\n",

      "Term Limits\n",

      "Q.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please state your position on term limits.\n",

      "And if you are in favor of them, how will you get them enacted?\n",
      "\n",
      "President Bush.\n",

      "Any order?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll be glad to respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "I strongly support term limits for Members of the United States Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe it would return the Government closer to the people, the way that Ross Perot is talking about.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President's terms are limited to two, a total of 8 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's wrong with limiting the terms of Members of Congress to 12?\n",
      "\n",
      "Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 38 years, one party has controlled the House of Representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the result?\n",
      "\n",
      "A sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all of Chase Bank and Citibank put together.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got to do something about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you get a certain arrogance, bureaucratic arrogance if people stay there too long.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I favor, strongly favor term limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "And how to get them passed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Send us some people that will pass the idea, and I think you will.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the American people want it now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyplace I go, I talk about it, and I think they want it done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, you'd have to have some amendments to the Constitution because of the way the Constitution reads.\n",

      "\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Clinton?\n",

      "Governor Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know they're popular, but I'm against them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll tell you why.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe, number one, it would pose a real problem for a lot of smaller States in the Congress who would have enough trouble now making sure their interests are heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Number two, I think it would increase the influence of unelected staff members in the Congress who have too much influence already.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to cut the size of the congressional staffs, but I think you're going to have too much influence there with people who were never elected who have lots of expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Number three, if the people really have a mind to change, they can.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're going to have 120 to 150 new Members of Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let me tell you what I favor instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we're doing now.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you did that, you could take away the incumbent's advantage, because challengers like me would have a chance to run against incumbents like him for the House races and Senate races, and then the voters could make up their own mind without being subject to an unfair fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that's how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we'd get the changes you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Simpson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Perot, would you like to address term limitations?\n",

      "\n",
      "I do not intend to spend one minute of one day thinking about reelection.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a matter of principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "My situation is unique, and I understand it.\n",

      "I will take absolutely no compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I go as their servant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I have set as strong an example as I can.\n",
      "\n",
      "And at that point, when we sit down over at Capitol Hill -- tomorrow night I'm going to be talking about Government reform.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a long subject; you wouldn't let me finish tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to hear it, you can get it tomorrow night.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Laughter] But the point is, you'll hear it tomorrow night.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we have got to reform Government.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you put term limits in and don't reform Government, you won't get the benefit you thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "It takes both.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we need to do the reforms and the term limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "And after we reform it, it won't be a lifetime career opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good people will go serve and then go back to their homes, and not become foreign lobbyists and cash in at 30,000 bucks a month, and then take time off to run some President's campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "They're all nice people.\n",
      "\n",
      "They're just in a bad system.\n",

      "Ms. Simpson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a question over here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Health Care Reform\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. I'd like to ask Governor Clinton, do you attribute the rising costs of health care to the medical profession itself, or do you think the problem lies elsewhere?\n",
      "\n",
      "And what specific proposals do you have to tackle this problem?\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had more people talk to me about their health care problems, I guess, than anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "All across America, people who have lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children -- so let me try to answer you in this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with the premise.\n",
      "\n",
      "We spend 30 percent more of our income than any nation on Earth on health care.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, we insure fewer people.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have 35 million people without any insurance at all, and I see them all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "One hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if you analyze where we're out of line with other countries you come up with the following conclusions: Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative costs, bureaucracy, and Government regulation that wouldn't be spent in any other nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employers would cover their employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Government would cover the unemployed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Number two, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can't keep raising drug prices at 3 times the rate of inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you have to take on medical fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines, that raises the presumption that they didn't do anything wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you have to have a system of primary preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the key is to control the costs and maintain the quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "To do that, you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups, and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals from a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think there has to be -- I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this -- there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation plus population growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let me say, some people say we can't do this, but Hawaii does it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They cover 98 percent of their people, and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "So does Rochester, New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "They now have a plan to cover everybody, and their premiums are two-thirds the rest of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my Presidency.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's terribly important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Simpson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry to cut you short, but, President Bush, health care reform.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Bush.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just have to say something.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to stampede -- Ross was very articulate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the country, I don't want anybody to stampede to cut the President's salary off altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara is sitting over here, and I -- [laughter] -- but what I have proposed, 10 percent cut, downsize the Government, and we can get that done.\n",
      "\n",
      "She asked the question, I think, is whether the health care profession was to blame.\n",
      "\n",
      "No.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are breaking the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "It costs $20 to $25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctors don't dare to deliver babies sometimes because they're afraid that somebody's going to sue them.\n",
      "\n",
      "People don't dare, medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt because they're afraid that some lawyer's going to come along and get a big lawsuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "So you can't blame the practitioners or the health -- and my program is this: Keep the Government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor through vouchers, next range in the income bracket through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "A great, big company can buy -- Ross has got a good size company, been very successful.\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, listen, you ought to be in the White House for a day and hear what I hear and see what I see and read the mail I read and touch the people that I touch from time to time.\n",

      "I was in the Lomax AME Church.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a black church just outside of Washington, DC, and I read in the bulletin about teenage pregnancies, about the difficulty that families are having to make ends meet.\n",

      "\n",
      "I don't think it's fair to say, whatever it is, if you haven't been hit by it personally.\n",
      "\n",
      "But everybody's affected by the debt, because of the tremendous interest that goes into paying on that debt, everything's more expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything comes out of your pocket and my pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it's that.\n",

      "I'll tell you how it's affected me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every year, Congress and the President sign laws that make us do more things; it gives us less money to do it with.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see people in my State, middle class people, their taxes have gone up from Washington and their services have gone down, while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts.\n",

      "\n",
      "What I want you to understand is, the national debt is not the only cause of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is because America has not invested in its people.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is because we have not grown.\n",

      "It is because we've had 12 years of trickle-down economics.\n",

      "We've gone from 1st to 12th in the world in wages.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this decision you're about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want, not just people saying, \"I want to go fix it,\" but what are we going to do.\n",

      "Entitlement Programs\n",
      "\n",
      "Q.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "My name is Ben Smith.\n",
      "\n",
      "I work in the financial field, counseling retirees.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'm personally concerned about three major areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "One is the Social Security Administration or trust fund is projected to be insolvent by the year 2036.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've funded the trust fund with IOU's in the form of Treasury bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pension guaranty fund which backs up our private retirement plans for retirees is projected to be bankrupt by the year 2026, not to mention the cutbacks by private companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Medicare is projected to be bankrupt maybe as soon as 1997.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like from each of you a specific response as to what you intend to do for retirees relative to these issues, not generalities but specifics, because I think they're very disturbing issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Simpson.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Bush, may we start with you?\n",
      "\n",
      "President Bush.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the Social Security -- you're an expert and I could, I'm sure, learn from you the details of the pension guaranty fund and the Social Security fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Social Security system was fixed, about 5 years, and I think it's projected out to be sound beyond that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So at least we have time to work with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going.\n",
      "\n",
      "Growth in the economy is going to add to the overall prosperity and wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't give you a specific answer on pension guaranty fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "All I know is that we have firm Government credit to guarantee the pensions, and that is very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the full faith in credit of the United States, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's still the most respected credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I would simply say, as these dates get close you're going to have to reorganize and refix as we did with the Social Security fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's the only answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the more immediate answer is to do what this lady was suggesting we do, and that is to get this deficit down and get on without adding to the woes, and then restructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I've called for that has been stymied, and I'll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages, and it's a big fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to give my friend Ross another shot at me here, but I am fighting with the Congress to get this through.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can't just go up and say, \"I'm going to fix it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You've got some pretty strong-willed guys up there that argue with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that's what the election's about; I agree with the Governor.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's what the election is about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sound fiscal policy is the best answer, I think, to all the three problems you mentioned.\n",

      "\n",
      "When you're trying to solve a problem, you get the best plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have a raging debate about those plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if the plans are huge and complex, like health care, I would urge you to implement pilot programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the older carpenter says, measure twice, cut once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's make sure this thing's as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, finally, our Government passes laws and freezes the plan in concrete.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anybody that's ever built a successful business will tell you, you optimize, optimize, optimize after you put something into effect.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Everybody knows how to fix them.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, back over here.\n",
      "\n",
      "See, we've got a $4 trillion debt, and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it, or 70 percent of it, financed 5 years or less.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that's another thing for you to think about when you go home tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "You don't finance long-term debt with short-term money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did our Government do it?\n",
      "\n",
      "To get the interest rates down.\n",
      "\n",
      "A one-percent increase in interest rates in that $2.8 trillion is $28 billion a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, when you look at what Germany pays for money and what we don't pay for money, you realize there's quite a spread, right?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "It's being worked now in 1,700 communities -- I bypassed Congress on this one, Ross -- 1,700 communities across the country.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "We have a concept called the New American School Corporation, where we're doing exactly that.\n",

      "\n",
      "But let me start with what you've said.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it's nowhere near enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18-year-old will change jobs eight times in a lifetime, and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on.\n",

      "Nobody running can promise that.\n",

      "Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to States to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job a chance to get a high school diploma, in big places, on the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Number two, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don't go to college, in community colleges or on the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Number three, we'd open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income.\n",
      "\n",
      "They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income over the couple of years of service to our Nation here home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Number four, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five, I would have an aggressive program of school reform.\n",
      "\n",
      "More choices in the -- I favor public schools or these new charter schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can talk about that if you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think we should spend tax money on private schools, but I favor public school choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools.\n",

      "What is it going to cost?\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 6 years -- I budget all this in my budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 6 years, the college program would cost $8 billion over and above what -- the present student loan program costs 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "You pay $3 billion for busted loans, because we don't have an automatic recovery system, and a billion dollars in bank fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the net cost will be $8 billion 6 years from now, in a trillion-plus budget: not very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other stuff, all the other stuff I mentioned costs much less than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Head Start program, full funding, would cost about $5 billion more.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's all covered in my budget from the plans that I've laid out, from raising taxes on families with incomes above $200,000, and asking foreign corporations to pay the same tax that American corporations do on the same income; from $140 billion in budget cuts, including what I think are very prudent cuts in the defense budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's all covered in the plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Simpson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Perot, you on education, please.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Perot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've got scars to show from being around education reform.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first words you need to say in every city and State and just draw a line in the sand -- public schools exist for the benefit of the children -- you're going to see a lot of people fall over it, because any time you're spending $199 billion a year, somebody's getting it, and the children get lost in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that's step one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind in 1960 when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we spend more than any other nation in the world, $199 billion a year, and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of educational achievement.\n",
      "\n",
      "One more time, you've bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a Government that's not serving you.\n",
      "\n",
      "By and large, it should be local.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more local, the better.\n",

      "The best people in a small town will serve on the school board.\n",
      "\n",
      "You get into big cities, it's political patronage, stepping stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "You get the job, give your relatives the janitor's job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with luck, they clean the cafeteria once a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, you're paying for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those schools belong to you, and we put up with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as you put up with that, that's what you're going to get.\n",
      "\n",
      "These folks are just dividing up 199 billion bucks, and the children get lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing will ever replace that.\n",
      "\n",
      "You say, \"Well, gee, what are you going to do about that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's nothing -- the most efficient unit of Government we'll ever know is a strong, loving family unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "You need small schools, not big schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little school, everybody's somebody.\n",
      "\n",
      "Individualism is very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "These big factories, everybody told me they were cost-effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did a study on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They're cost-ineffective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five thousand students: why is a high school that big?\n",
      "\n",
      "One reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sooner or later, you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil, that weigh 250 pounds, and they might win district.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that has nothing to do with learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, across Texas, typically half the school day was nonacademic pursuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one place, it was 35 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Texas, you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Found a boy -- excuse me, but this gives the flavor -- a boy in Houston kept a chicken in the bathtub in downtown Houston.\n",
      "\n",
      "Missed 65 days going to livestock shows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost his feathers.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the only way we got him back.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Laughter] Now, that's your tax money being wasted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, neighborhood schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is particularly terrible to take poor, tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage; the end of the first day, that little child wants out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I close on this: You've got to have world-class teachers, world-class books.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldn't want to go back the second day.\n",

      "If we don't fix this, you're right, we can't have the industries of tomorrow unless we have the best educated work force.\n",

      "\n",

      "My school choice program, \"GI bill\" for kids, does not take public money and give it to private schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "It does what the GI bill itself did when I came out of World War II.\n",
      "\n",
      "It takes public money and gives it to families or individuals to choose the school they want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where it's been done, those schools, like in Rochester, those schools that weren't chosen find that they then compete and do better.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think it's worth a shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got a pilot program.\n",
      "\n",
      "It ought to be tried: school choice, public, private, or religious, not to the schools, but to -- 46 percent of the teachers in Chicago, public schoolteachers, send their kids to private school.\n",

      "There are nine countries that spend more than we do on public education.\n",
      "\n",
      "We spend more on education because we spend so much more on colleges.\n",

      "I'm Dorothy Ridings, president of the League of Women Voters, the sponsor of tonight's first Presidential debate between Republican Ronald Reagan and Democrat Walter Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight's debate marks the third consecutive Presidential election in which the League is presenting the candidates for the Nation's highest office in face-to-face debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our panelists are James Wieghart, national political correspondent for Scripps-Howard News Service; Diane Sawyer, correspondent for the CBS program \"60 Minutes;\" and Fred Barnes, national political correspondent for the Baltimore Sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara Walters of ABC News, who is appearing in her fourth Presidential debate, is our moderator.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few words as we begin tonight's debate about the format.\n",
      "\n",
      "The position of the candidates-that is, who answers questions first and who gives the last statement--was determined by a toss of a coin between the two candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale won, and that means that he chose to give the final closing statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "It means, too, that the President will answer the first question first.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope that's clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it isn't, it will become clear as the debate goes on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the candidates will be addressed as they each wanted and will, therefore, be called \"Mr. President\" and \"Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mondale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Since there will also be a second debate between the two Presidential candidates, tonight will focus primarily on the economy and other domestic issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The debate, itself, is built around questions from the panel.\n",
      "\n",
      "In each of its segments, a reporter will ask the candidates the same general question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then--and this is important-each candidate will have the chance to rebut what the other has said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the final segment of the debate will be the closing segment, and the candidates will each have 4 minutes for their closing statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as I have said, Mr. Mondale will be the last person on the program to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now I would like to add a personal note if I may.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Dorothy Ridings pointed out, I have been involved now in four Presidential debates, either as a moderator or as a panelist.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, there was no problem in selecting panelists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight, however, there were to have been four panelists participating in this debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The candidates were given a list of almost 100 qualified journalists from all the media and could agree on only these three fine journalists.\n",
      "\n",
      "As moderator, and on behalf of my fellow journalists, I very much regret, as does the League of Women Voters, that this situation has occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now let us begin the debate with the first question from James Wieghart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nation's Economy\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, in 1980 you promised the American people--in your campaign--a balanced budget by 1983.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've now had more and bigger deficits in the 4 years you've been in office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, do you have a secret plan to balance the budget sometime in a second term, and if so, would you lay out that plan for us tonight?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a plan--not a secret plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us--the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget--no, that was no longer possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs--there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending--the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has some bad news.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lines aren't about to meet, according to their projections.\n",
      "\n",
      "They project that the budget deficit will continue to climb.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 1989 they project a budget deficit of $273 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of that, and in view of the economic recovery we are now enjoying, would it make sense to propose a tax increase or take some other fiscal measures to reduce that deficit now, when times are relatively good?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deficit is the result of excessive government spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasn't going to take place to begin with.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it has taken place.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent-we're not far from there--by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean--without an increase in tax rates--that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, I think that the lines can meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale, the Carter-Mondale administration didn't come close to balancing the budget in its 4 years in office either, despite the fact that President Carter did promise a balanced budget during his term.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have proposed a plan combining tax increases and budgetary cuts and other changes in the administration of the Government that would reduce the projected budget deficit by two-thirds, to approximately $87 billion in 1989.\n",
      "\n",
      "That still is an enormous deficit that will be running for these 4 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "What other steps do you think should be taken to reduce this deficit and position the country for economic growth?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.\n",
      "\n",
      "I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they've missed the mark by nearly $600 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was $200 billion deficit instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.\n",
      "\n",
      "It gets larger even with growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the worst trade year in American history by far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Real interest rates--the real cost of interest-will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that's fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've stood up and told the American people that I think it's a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I've told you what I think should be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale, one other way to attack the deficit is further reductions in spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President has submitted a number of proposals to Congress to do just that, and in many instances the House, controlled by the Democrats, has opposed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isn't it one aspect of leadership for prominent Democrats such as yourself to encourage responsible reductions in spending, and thereby reduce the deficit?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things-- [applause] --that people need.\n",
      "\n",
      "These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to ask the audience please to refrain from applauding either side; it just takes away from the time for your candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now it is time for the rebuttal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, 1 minute for rebuttal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you're taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government's share of what it is taking.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to Social Security, I hope there'll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say \"never.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm going to violate that rule and say \"never.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent-reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying--with widows trying to get them through college.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody remembers that; people know what happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll now begin with segment number two with my colleague, Diane Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Leadership Qualities\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, Mr. Mondale, the public opinion polls do suggest that the American people are most concerned about the personal leadership characteristics of the two candidates, and each of you has questioned the other's leadership ability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, you have said that Mr. Mondale's leadership would take the country down the path of defeatism and despair, and Vice President Bush has called him whining and hoping for bad news.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, Mr. Mondale, you have said that President Reagan offers showmanship, not leadership, that he has not mastered what he must know to command his government.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to ask each of you to substantiate your claims--Mr. Mondale first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Give us specifics to support your claim that President Reagan is a showman, not a leader; has not mastered what he must know to be President after 4 years, and then, second, tell us what personal leadership characteristics you have that he does not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one else believes that's the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do, and I'm standing up to the issue with an answer that's fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's what leadership is all about.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there's a real problem, a President must confront it.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time--and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen--once, and sometimes twice-the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am answering your questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have said, Mr. Mondale, that the polls have given you lower ratings on leadership than President Reagan because your message has failed to get through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that you have been in public office for so many years, what accounts for the failure of your message to get through?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr, Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I think we're getting better all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, the issue is leadership in personal terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, do you think, as Vice President Bush said, that Mr. Mondale's campaign is one of whining and hoping for bad news?\n",
      "\n",
      "And second, what leadership characteristics do you possess that Mr. Mondale does not?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security-before I get to the answer to your question--the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.\n",
      "\n",
      "In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society--that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, having that, I think also that in leadership--well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I'm in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I also believe something else about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that--and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office--that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to hear them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people--is it morally right?\n",
      "\n",
      "And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred--that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a followup, let me draw in another specific, if I could--a specific that the Democrats have claimed about your campaign--that it is essentially based on imagery.\n",
      "\n",
      "And one specific that they allege is that, for instance, recently you showed up at the opening ceremony of a Buffalo old-age housing project, when in fact, your policy was to cut Federal housing subsidies for the elderly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet you were there to have your picture taken with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our policy was not to cut subsidies.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is what we've been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we're going to continue along that line.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need.\n",
      "\n",
      "The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale, an opportunity for you to rebut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, \"It's not what he doesn't know that bothers me; it's what he knows for sure that just ain't so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[Laughter] The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not an opinion; it's a fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when the President was asked the other day, \"What do you want to cut in the budget?\n",
      "\n",
      "\", he said, \"Cut those things I asked for but didn't get.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That's Social Security and Medicare.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President's budget sought to terminate.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn't solve them for 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, we made a proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I'd asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, we begin segment number three with Fred Barnes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Religion\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, would you describe your religious beliefs, noting particularly whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how these beliefs affect your Presidential decisions?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our particular church, we did not use that term, \"born again,\" so I don't know whether I would fit that--that particular term.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have--thanks to my mother, God rest her soul--the firmest possible belief and faith in God.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I don't believe--I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not--I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I do resort to prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign--or religion a part of that campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, it does play a part in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no hesitancy in saying so.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given those beliefs, Mr. President, why don't you attend services regularly, either by going to church or by inviting a minister to the White House, as President Nixon used to do, or someone to Camp David, as President Carter used to do?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer to your question is very simple about why I don't go to church.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut--we're supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand--but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know the threats that are made against me.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all know the possibility of terrorism.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, therefore, I don't feel--and my minister knows this and supports me in this position--I don't feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Applause]\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "May I ask you, please-- [applause] --may I ask the audience please to refrain from applause.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred, your second question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale, would you describe your religious beliefs and mention whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how those beliefs would affect your decisions as President?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, I accept President Reagan's affirmation of faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a son of a Methodist minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I don't know if I've been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether that helps or not, I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a deep religious faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our family does.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is fundamental.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's probably the reason that I'm in politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think we're all together on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one's own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others' faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others.\n",
      "\n",
      "All history tells us that that's a mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "This nation is the most religious nation on Earth--more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth-and it's because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think if we want to continue--as I do--to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes, next question.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have time for rebuttal now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I have a followup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I asked you if you did.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sorry.--\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "--I thought you waived it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Mr. Mondale, you've complained, just now, about Jerry Falwell, and you've complained other times about other fundamentalists in politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't recall your ever complaining about ministers who are involved in the civil rights movement or in the anti-Vietnam war demonstrations or about black preachers who've been so involved in American politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it only conservative ministers that you object to?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale, No.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I object to-- [applause] --what I object to--what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.\n",
      "\n",
      "A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political--or private religious faith and the use of the state is where--for the most personal decisions in American life--that's where I draw the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Mr. President, rebuttal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O'Connor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll stand on my record on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal, please.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's take the example that the President cites.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe in prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "My family prays.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "They don't want this arms race.\n",
      "\n",

      "The American people see this debt, and they know it's got to come down.\n",

      "\n",
      "They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they know this debt must come down as well, because it's unfair to our children.\n",

      "\n",
      "They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people's lives and health are being risked, because we've had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment.\n",

      "The American people want their children educated.\n",

      "\n",
      "I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.\n",

      "But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll continue to try to get things that we didn't get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago--I know, because I was a Democrat at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people.\n",
      "\n",
      "I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have, to onethird of what it was.\n",

      "I promised that we would reduce taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "We did, 25 percent across the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "That barely held even with--if it did that much--with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at least it took that burden away from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did--6 million in the last 20 or 21 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have done that.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think this is something the American people see.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education--on excellence in education.\n",
      "\n",
      "And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, much of what you said affects the quality of life of many Americans--their income, the way they live, and so forth--but there's an aspect to quality of life that lies beyond the private sector which has to do with our neighborhoods, our cities, our streets, our parks, our environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In those areas, I have difficulty seeing what your program is and what you feel the Federal responsibility is in these areas of the quality of life in the public sector that affects everybody, and even enormous wealth by one individual can't create the kind of environment that he might like.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you've named some of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down--or since we've kept records--2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The environment?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program--but it's just about finished already--a billion dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that we're out in front of most--and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can't continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I've got more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, you'll have a chance when your rebuttal time comes up, perhaps,\n",

      "Mr. President.\n",

      "\n",
      "The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was chairman of \"Minnesotans for Kennedy;\" President Reagan was chairman of a thing called \"Democrats for Nixon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I'll be proud of supporting him all of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'm very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President just said that his government is shrinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And instead of retreating.--instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's where government should not be.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, my change had come earlier than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found that was rather difficult to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I finally did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some other things that have been said here--back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers' worst year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done.\n",
      "\n",
      "The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21 1/2-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of i percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.\n",

      "Abortion\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to turn to an area that I think few people enjoy discussing, but that we probably should tonight because the positions of the two candidates are so clearly different and lead to very different policy consequences--and that is abortion and right to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm exploring for your personal views of abortion and specifically how you would want them applied as public policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you consider abortion murder or a sin?\n",
      "\n",
      "And second, how hard would you work--what kind of priority would you give in your second term legislation to make abortion illegal?\n",
      "\n",
      "And specifically, would you make certain, as your party platform urges, that Federal justices that you appoint be pro-life?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is-there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.\n",
      "\n",
      "With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying--I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious--there were clerics there-everyone talking about this matter of pro-life.\n",
      "\n",
      "And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.\n",
      "\n",
      "In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor--signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, isn't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that's murder?\n",
      "\n",
      "And it used the term \"death of the unborn child.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine--and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "A two-part followup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do I take it from what you've said about the platform, then, that you don't regard the language and don't regard in your own appointments, abortion position a test of any kind for justices--that it should be?\n",
      "\n",
      "And also, if abortion is made illegal, how would you want it enforced?\n",
      "\n",
      "Who would be the policing units that would investigate?\n",
      "\n",
      "And would you want the women who have abortions to be prosecuted?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "The laws regarding that always were State laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our laws against murder are State laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve.\n",
      "\n",
      "And no one has approached it from that matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that some churches do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale, to turn to you, do you consider abortion a murder or a sin?\n",
      "\n",
      "And bridging from what President Reagan said, he has written that if society doesn't know whether life does--human life, in fact, does begin at conception, as long as there is a doubt, that the unborn child should at least be given the benefit of the doubt and that there should be protection for that unborn child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your living rooms and making choices like this?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?\n",
      "\n",
      "Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "We haven't felt so insecure that we've reached for the club of state to have our point of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been a good instinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we're the most religious people on Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal pro-abortion bill of any State in the Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if I can get you back for a moment on my point, which was the question of when human life begins--a two-part followup.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, at what point do you believe that human life begins in the growth of a fetus?\n",
      "\n",
      "And second of all, you said that government shouldn't be involved in the decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet there are those who would say that government is involved, and the consequence of the involvement was 1.5 million abortions in 1980.\n",
      "\n",
      "And how do you feel about that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and that's the way it's been done.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know the answer to when life begins.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it's not that simple, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "You've got another life involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?\n",
      "\n",
      "If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?\n",
      "\n",

      "Do you think that those families are overtaxed or undertaxed by the Federal Government?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a fiat tax.\n",

      "In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe we need some fairness.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds as if you are saying you think this group of taxpayers making 25,000 to 45,000 a year is already overtaxed, yet your tax proposal would increase their taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think your aides have said those earning about 25,000 to 35,000, their tax rate would go up--their tax bill would go up a hundred dollars, and from 35,000 to 45,000, more than that, several hundred dollars.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",

      "Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes.\n",

      "\n",
      "There you go again.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax--or increase taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not going to increase taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it's that government is overfed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think that most of our people--this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down.\n",
      "\n",
      "From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the Social Security tax of '77--this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had two features.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time--there are two more yet to come between now and 1989.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money--virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there--that was subject to that tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20--they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barnes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought I caught, Mr. President, a glimmer of a stronger statement there in your answer than you've made before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the operative position you had before was that you would only raise taxes in a second term as a last resort, and I thought you said flatly that \"I'm not going to raise taxes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Is that what you meant to say, that you will not--that you will flatly not raise taxes in your second term as President'?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I had used--\"last resort\" would always be with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there--had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.\n",

      "Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "They've got so many loopholes they don't have to pay much in taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Mr. President, you said, \"There you go again,\" right?\n",

      "\n",
      "There have been a number of studies, including studies by the Urban Institute and other nonpolitical organizations, that say that the impact of the tax and budget cuts and your economic policies have impacted severely on certain classes of Americans-working mothers, head of households, minority groups, elderly poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, they're saying the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer under your policies.\n",

      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, some of those facts and figures just don't stand up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, women heads of household--single women heads of household have--for the first time there's been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're spending a third more on all of the-well, all of the programs of human service.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before--2,300,000 more are receiving them--even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.\n",
      "\n",
      "We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.\n",

      "But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "We didn't think that was right.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low.\n",

      "7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings--7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.\n",

      "Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities--through the Urban Development Action Grant Program.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't mind those enterprise zones; let's try them, but not as a substitute for the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly education and training is crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "If these young Americans don't have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they're not going to get jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they're found.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no question that the poor are worse off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them for example, the disabled, who have no alternative--how they're going to do better, I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.\n",
      "\n",
      "One final point if I might.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's another part of the lopsided economy that we're in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's another reason to get the deficit down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wieghart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale, is it possible that the vast majority of Americans who appear to be prosperous have lost interest in the kinds of programs you're discussing to help those less privileged than they are?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think they stand for civil rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support.\n",
      "\n",
      "They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the business community wants to get involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's part of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they're not having to take money that's desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm opposed to that, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now it is time for our rebuttal for this period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The connection that's been made again between the deficit and the interest rates--there is no connection between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited--that the interest rates came down from 21 1/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were going up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interest rates are based on inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "And right now I have to tell you I don't think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope--expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it isn't going to go back up.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're going to see that it doesn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why--energy prices and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no way of glossing around that.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what's called the real interest rates--the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled--and that's still the case today.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and it's attributable to the deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody--every economist, every businessman-believes that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your own Council of Economic Advisers--Mr. Feldstein in his report told you that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every chairman of the Finance and Ways and Means Committee, Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are telling you that.\n",
      "\n",
      "That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's causing high interest rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's ruining us in trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's given us the highest small business failure in 50 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The economy is starting downhill with housing failure.-\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're both very obedient.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to give you credit for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "We now start our final round of questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do want to have time for your rebuttal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We start with Diane--Diane Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presidential Campaign\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we are reaching the end of the question period, and since in every Presidential campaign, the candidates tend to complain that the opposition candidate is not held accountable for what he or she says, let me give you the chance to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale, beginning with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you think the most outrageous thing is your opponent said in this debate tonight?\n",
      "\n",
      "[Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you want to give me some suggestions?\n",
      "\n",
      "[Laughter] I'm going to use my time a little differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to give the President some credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like President Reagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is not personal--there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow up in a similar vein, then.\n",
      "\n",
      "What remaining question would you most like to see your opponent forced to answer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I've done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I'd do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight--President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was once called voodoo economics.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is how I'm going to get it done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that's not helping.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's going to go in the other direction, as they've estimated.\n",
      "\n",
      "And give us a plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "What will you cut?\n",
      "\n",
      "Whose taxes will you raise?\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you finally touch that defense budget?\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's the way it should be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The American people would be in charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, the most outrageous thing your opponent has said in the debate tonight?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in '82.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And why I think it is outrageous--first of all, it isn't true.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, \"Is this true?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, to--I still--I just have a minute here?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have more time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, I--\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can keep going.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Social Security, let's lay it to rest once and for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told you never would I do such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "And none of these things happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is working, and we're going to continue on that same line.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we're studying right now--and we've already implemented 17 percent of them-that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "And to keep it even, what remaining question would you most like to see your opponent forced to answer?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits-there was nothing wrong with having deficits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don't do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'm hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why I want another 4 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we have time now, if you'd like to answer the President's question, or whatever rebuttal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Mondale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we've just finished almost the whole debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the American people don't have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Laughter] And yet, that's the most important single issue of our time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did support the '76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year.\n",
      "\n",
      "This administration seems to run that every morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the result is exactly what we see.\n",
      "\n",
      "This economy is starting to run downhill.\n",

      "Housing is off.\n",
      "\n",

      "Growth is a little over 3 percent now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people are predicting a recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we're going to do, so you can make a judgment.\n",

      "I asked: \"Are you better off than you were 4 years before?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not going to, because I think that all of you--or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven't caught up, they couldn't answer the way I would want them to--but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question, I think, should be enlarged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is America better off than it was 4 years ago?\n",

      "But we now have an economy that, for the first time--well, let's put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first half of '84 it's up 8 1/2 percent.\n",

      "\n",
      "In 1980--or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.\n",

      "We have restored much of our economy.\n",

      "With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949.\n",

      "So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital.\n",

      "To me, that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should give a tax cut targeted to childrearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care.\n",

      "We ought to help protect our kids from drugs and guns and gangs and tobacco.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ought to help move a million people from welfare to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we ought to create the finest education system in the world, where every 18-year-old can go on to college and all of our younger children have great educational opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we do those things, we can build that bridge to the 21st century.\n",

      "Well, I would say, first of all, I think it's a very good question, and I appreciate the quote from the young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government.\n",
      "\n",
      "They see scandals almost on a daily basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "They see ethical problems in the White House today.\n",
      "\n",
      "They see 900 FBI files of private persons being gathered up by somebody in the White House; nobody knows who hired this man.\n",
      "\n",
      "So there's a great deal of cynicism out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I've always tried, in whatever I've done, to bring people together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said in my acceptance speech in San Diego about 2 months ago that the exits are clearly marked.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you think the Republican Party is someplace for you to come if you're narrow-minded or bigoted or don't like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of, as I stand here without compromise because this is the party of Lincoln.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we have a real obligation, obviously, public officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm no longer a public official; I left public life on June 11th of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young people are looking to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "They're looking to us for leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "They're watching what we do, what we say, what we promise, and what we finally deliver.\n",

      "One of the reasons that I ran for President, Sandy, is because not just children, a lot of grownups felt that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you remember, 4 years ago we had not only rising unemployment but a lot of rising cynicism.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd never worked in Washington as an elected official.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to me that most of the arguments were partisan: Republican, Democrat; left, right; liberal, conservative.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why I said tonight I'm for opportunity, responsibility, and community.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we've gotten some real progress in the last 4 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've also done everything I could at every moment of division in this country‚Äîafter Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned‚Äîto bring people together and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity.\n",

      "\n",
      "It's important that we go beyond those old partisan arguments and focus on people and their future.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we do that, instead of shutting the Government down over a partisan fight on the budget, we're a better country, and that's why we're making progress now.\n",

      "Everybody here does it.\n",
      "\n",
      "You do a lot of things nobody knows about.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a little foundation for the disabled called the Dole Foundation.\n",

      "We don't talk about it.\n",

      "\n",
      "We bring them back into the mainstream of public life.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it seems to me that there's also a public trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you're the President of the United States, you have a public trust, and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington did and as Abraham Lincoln did.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think now that trust is being violated.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it seems to me we ought to face up to it, and the President ought to say tonight that he's not going to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who might implicate him later on.\n",

      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, let me say what we have done: In the last 4 years, we've worked hard to promote more competition to bring down the rate of inflation in health care costs without eroding health care quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Government pays for Medicare and Medicaid, as you know, and that's very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, we've added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have protected 25 million people through the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you can't lose your health insurance if you change jobs or if someone in your family's been sick.\n",

      "We just recently ended those drive-by deliveries, saying people couldn't be kicked out of the hospital by insurance companies when they'd just had babies.\n",

      "In the next 4 years, I want to focus on the following things: Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program; number two, keep working with the States, as we are now, to add 2.2 million more people to the insurance system; number three, cover people who are between jobs for up to 6 months‚Äîthat could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids; and number four, make sure we protect the integrity of the Medicare program and the Medicaid program and not do anything in cutting costs which would cause hundreds of hospitals to close, as could have been the case if the $270 billion Medicare cut that I vetoed had been enacted into law.\n",

      "First, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut.\n",

      "Now, I've heard you say this time after time, and I've heard you say on one TV appearance, \"The media made me do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You were trying to defend your cut, which was not a cut either‚Äîa reduction in the growth of spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we always had at least 7 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "You've said publicly that it's now 3 times the rate of inflation, we ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's about where we are now.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let's stop talking about cutting Medicare.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my economic plan we increase it 39 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't forget what he tried to do with health care: 17 new taxes, spend $1.5 trillion, 50 new bureaucracies.\n",

      "Can you believe that?\n",
      "\n",
      "You couldn't even have been a cardiologist because they had quotas.\n",
      "\n",
      "You had‚Äîyou couldn't‚Äîyou're a cardiologist; it wouldn't affect you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist 10 years from now, you'd have to be certain that you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the Government was going to take over for all Americans.\n",

      "There are things we can do like the Kassebaum bill, that retains many provisions I authored, to cover preexisting‚Äîexisting‚Äîportability.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there are other things we can do.\n",
      "\n",
      "We still need to cover about 20 million people and a lot of children.\n",

      "The President.\n",

      "I don't have time in 30 seconds to respond to fix all that.\n",

      "But let me just say, the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals, not me.\n",
      "\n",
      "And on a per-person basis, it did cut way below the rate of inflation in medical costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the important thing is, what are we going to do now?\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to help people who are between jobs.\n",

      "We need to cover more kids.\n",

      "Yes, sir?\n",
      "\n",
      "Armed Forces\n",
      "\n",
      "Q.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole, my name is Jason Milligan, active-duty military and a small-business owner.\n",
      "\n",
      "And my question is, what is your position on closing the gap between military and civilian pay scales?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a former military man myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, we have 17,000 men and women today wearing our uniform that receive food stamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "It shouldn't happen in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have men and women wearing our uniform in substandard housing.\n",
      "\n",
      "It shouldn't happen in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it's time we take a look at the pay scales.\n",
      "\n",
      "You did get a 3 percent increase this year, but that's not enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we're going to ask young men and young women to protect us and defend us around the world, and we've had more deployments under this administration than any time in history‚Äî 50 times we deployed troops around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time you do that, you take a risk‚Äîsomebody you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember Vietnam, remember when people almost used to walk across the street rather than have contact with somebody who was in Vietnam‚Äîthat's all behind us now, and it should be behind us‚Äîand the forgotten war, the Korean war.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I guess, I can just answer you very plainly, Jason: Thank you for doing what you're doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "America owes you a debt of gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "May I ask you a question?\n",
      "\n",
      "What kind of‚Äîwhich service are you in?\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. I'm in the United States Navy, sir.\n",

      "The President.\n",

      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, let me say‚ÄîSenator Dole mentioned this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just signed a bill that we got through Congress to increase the amount of pay increase we could give for military personnel and to make sure the pay increase this year was above the rate of inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also had presented to the Congress, and they adopted, a large package of quality-of-life improvements which are very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've spent a lot of time talking to military families, as well as military members, all over the world and in bases all across the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I became convinced, after talking to the families and the personnel in uniform, that we needed to not only have the pay raise but we needed to invest more in child care, housing, and other things to support families, especially when there are longer deployments because of the downsizing of the military.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we're going to do better, and we'll do better still.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is a commitment I think that all Americans share, without regard to party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Jason, I don't disagree with anything the President said except he waited 4 years to do these things.\n",
      "\n",
      "And my view is it ought to be‚Äîit'll be done on day one.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll start working on it on day one in the Dole-Kemp administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we only have 10 divisions now; we used to have 18.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had 25 fighter wings; we're down to 13.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had 536 ships; we're down to 336 ships.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, we've cut defense spending too much in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President told you in '92 he would cut it $67 billion; he cut $112 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we're right on the edge right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniform sacrifice.\n",

      "Mr. Lehrer.\n",

      "Next question here for President Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, ma'am, here on the front row.\n",
      "\n",
      "Middle East Peace Process\n",
      "\n",
      "Q.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Clinton, my name is Cecily Kelly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday Yasser Arafat said in Palestine that he thinks the key to success in the Middle East is the commitment of Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you, as President, send American troops to Israel or the West Bank as peacekeepers?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me just take 2 seconds of my time, because I'm the Commander in Chief, to respond to one thing that was said.\n",
      "\n",
      "I propose to spend $1.6 trillion on defense between now and the year 2002.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there's less than one percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, on the Middle East, as you know, I've worked very hard for peace in the Middle East.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was signed at the White House.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the agreement, the peace treaty with Jordan, I went to Jordan to sign that, to be there.\n",
      "\n",
      "But‚Äî and I think the United States could do whatever we reasonably can.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can say this: I do not believe Yasser Arafat wants us to send troops to the West Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw the agreement that Prime Minister Rabin and Yasser Arafat signed on the West Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had 26 separate maps they had to sign, literally thousands of delineations of who would do what on the West Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I believe if the parties will get together and in a good faith manner make that agreement, that they'll be able to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We cannot impose a peace on the Middle East.\n",
      "\n",
      "My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, if they ask me to be part of some monitoring force‚Äîas we are in the Sinai and have been since 1978 to monitor the peace between Egypt and Israel‚Äîfrankly, I would have to think about it; I would have to see what they wanted to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I don't believe that will be the request.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they've already made.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why I brought the leaders to Washington a few days ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think they will, and I think we'll get there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't be too discouraged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, let me, Jason, come back to you a minute because there is a big difference in the defense budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had $7 billion this year, and $10 billion more than the President.\n",
      "\n",
      "He puts his money in the out years‚Äî even if he were reelected, you know, he'd be gone before anything happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "And nothing's going to happen, because we don't have modernization now.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we don't build more B-2 bombers in California‚Äîand we lost about 500,000 jobs out in California because of this devastation, these big, big cuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had to make cuts; we didn't have to make the cuts the President promised he'd make and then he doubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so I think we need to go back and take a look.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're increasing defense reasonably, not too much but we are increasing defense some, because we want to be prepared in case somebody here gets called up, Jason.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would say I didn't hear what Yasser Arafat had to say, but I don't want to‚Äîyou know, I think foreign policy is something we want to be very careful about.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'm not here to argue about the President on some ongoing foreign policy matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it in his last statement, is call for an unconditional end to the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's sort of keep this out of politics, because it's pretty dicey right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the change of government occurred in Israel, the people of Israel were saying, \"We don't want to abandon the peace process.\n",
      "\n",
      "We want more security.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, a lot of mutual distrust developed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of things happened which maybe shouldn't have happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I asked Yasser Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for 3 hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, I'd say if they ask us to play some reasonable role, I don't know how I would respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would depend entirely on what they ask us to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the real secret there is for them to abide by the agreements they've made and find a way to trust each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they're going to have to spend some time and trust each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer.\n",
      "\n",
      "All right, next question from this section, and it is for Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in the back.\n",

      "About 30 years ago I was a pack-plus-a-day man, okay?\n",

      "You mentioned in a statement, you said some time ago that you didn't think nicotine was addictive.\n",

      "Oh, that‚Äîthat's very easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes that they may be dangerous‚ÄîI voted‚ÄîI voted for everything since that time.\n",

      "In fact, in 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the States had to comply or they're going to lose certain money.\n",
      "\n",
      "We sent it to the Clinton administration for implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "They waited 3 1/2 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you add it up, that's about 3 million‚Äînot until again 1996.\n",

      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it seems to me that what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use in 12- and 17year-olds has doubled in this administration, the last 44 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marijuana use is up 141 percent; cocaine use, up 160 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "They're your kids.\n",

      "We did propose a regulation 6 months after I became President under the law he mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "It simply says all these States‚Äîit made it illegal for kids to smoke‚Äînow they have to try harder if they want to keep getting Federal funds.\n",

      "That's what drug it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, we started, also in '93, to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market, and distribute tobacco products to our kids.\n",

      "First of all, they're two different things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social Security and Medicare are entirely different in terms of the financial stabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's talk about them separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we'd like to have a Social Security fund that has about 70 years of life instead of about 30 years of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments that take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think what we'll plainly do is what we did in 1983, when Senator Dole served‚Äîand this is something I think he did a good job on‚Äî when he served on the Social Security Commission and they made some modest changes in Social Security to make sure that it would be alive and well into the 21st century.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we will do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's obvious that there are certain things that have to be done, and there are 50 to 60 different options.\n",
      "\n",
      "And a bipartisan commission, to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medicare is different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medicare needs help now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have proposed a budget which would put 10 years on the life of the Medicare Trust Fund; that's more than it's had a lot of the time for the last 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would save a lot of money through more managed care but giving more options, more preventive care, and lowering the inflation rate in the prices we're paying providers without having the kind of big premium increases and outof-pocket costs that the budget I vetoed would provide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then that will give us 10 years to do with Medicare what we're going to do with Social Security: have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now we ought to pass this budget now and put 10 years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, again, you know, if you're somebody thinking about the future, I think it's fair to say that it'll be‚Äîwe'll work it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, this is a political year, and the President's playing politics with Medicare.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after this year's over we'll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in 1983.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a nonpartisan commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ronald Reagan got together with Tip O'Neill and Howard Baker‚Äîtwo Republicans and one Democrat‚Äîand they formed a commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was on that commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "We resolved‚Äîwe rescued Social Security.\n",
      "\n",
      "We suggested‚ÄîI think it's been over a year ago now‚Äî we do the same with Medicare, and the White House called it a gimmick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now last week, I guess it was, Donna Shalala said, \"Well, we'll cut Medicare a hundred billion, and we'll appoint a commission.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It will probably have to be done by a commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take it out of politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think if I were a senior citizen I'd be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans, and scaring students about education.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when you don't have any ideas, when you don't have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that's all you can use.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign, and we'll rescue Medicare as we did Social Security.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their idea was to have the poorest seniors in the country pay $270 more a year this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their idea was to budget‚Äî that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed‚Äînot in an election year, sir, I told them in early '95.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole said 30 years ago he was one of 12 people that voted against Medicare and he was proud of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A year ago he said, \"I was right then; I knew it wouldn't work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "American seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world.\n",

      "\n",
      "Next question from here, and it's for Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, ma'am, right here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me?\n",

      "Welfare Reform\n",
      "\n",
      "Q.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole, my name is Suzanne Gonzalez, and I would like to know what you are‚Äî what would be your first step in reforming welfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we've taken the first step.\n",
      "\n",
      "We took it three steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice we sent welfare reform to the President, and he vetoed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the third time we sent welfare reform to the President, he signed it but announced he would change it next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the Vice President said they were going to do something else through the line item veto, which I've never understood, but that's sort of inside baseball.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'm standing here as someone who a long time ago‚Äîas the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was to go through all the welfare checks and sign them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And three of those checks were my grandparents'.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I know what it's like to have to look welfare head-on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously some people are going to need help.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the United States of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're not going to go without food, and you're not going to go without medical care.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is America.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we're going to provide jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're going to say you have a 5-year limit that you can be on welfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "You've got 2 years to look for a job.\n",
      "\n",
      "We provided more money for day care in the bill that passed the Senate and was vetoed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it came back, and the President signed pretty much the same bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is an important issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, it puts a heavy burden on a State like‚Äîexcept for emergencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "It puts a heavy burden on States like California.\n",
      "\n",
      "It costs California taxpayers $3 billion a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Clinton?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll get out of your way here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly physically isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I'd been working on it when I was a Governor for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I became President, I used the authority I had in this law to get out from under certain Federal rules to help States move people to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I've got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector to give employers specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, to move more people from welfare to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is not a more important issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still remember a woman that I met 10 years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell‚Äîgive an answer when they say, \"What does your mother do for a job?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I met that woman again.\n",
      "\n",
      "She's got four kids.\n",
      "\n",
      "One's got a good job; one's studying to be a doctor; one's in technical school; one's an honor student in high school.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to make more people like that woman, Lillie Harden.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I've got a plan to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it's just beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, another thing we can do‚Äîwe talk about growth‚Äîwe've got a great economic package which I hope we'll discuss later: across the board tax cut; child credits, $500 per child under 18; reduce the capital gains rate; create more jobs and opportunities for people on and off welfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we have other provisions: less litigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial lawyers‚Äîbig supporters of the President‚Äîthe trial lawyers, of course they like lawsuits, so every time they have a bill that they want vetoed, the President vetoes it for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got to understand in America that we've got to have growth, create more jobs and more opportunities in the private sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President takes credit for all of these people off welfare‚Äîthe Governors did that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Federal Government doesn't do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the Government doesn't create jobs, they're created in the private sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer.\n",
      "\n",
      "This section, question?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, ma'am, on the back row.\n",

      "Capital Gains Tax\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Mr. President, my name is Pamela Johnson, and I'm a landlord.\n",
      "\n",
      "My question is, does your party have any future plans to reduce the capital gains tax, especially for retired Americans?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of my tax package, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains for people when they sell their home, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also have a capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was part of our other economic plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a stronger economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we can't have any tax cut that's not paid for.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I'm going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've worked hard to bring this deficit down, and that's helped people in the real estate business, because the interest rates are lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got homeownership at a 15year high.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've got this country going in the right direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we can have a tax cut, but my priority would be to help the families who need it with childrearing and education and buying a firsttime home and helping for health care costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "So from your business, helping in buying the first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Pamela.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Pamela, what the President didn't tell you is that all his tax cuts expire at the year 2000, but all his increases go on forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the liberal approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the net tax increase in his plan is somewhere between $60 billion and $80 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless your home is worth over $500,000‚Äîand if it is, I appreciate it, congratulate you‚Äîbut in any event, no tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it's a good idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "They saw it, and they picked it up and put in theirs, but it's only temporary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ours is permanent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ours is a good plan: create jobs and opportunities; capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it from 28 percent to 14 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are $7 trillion in assets locked up in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we cut the capital gains rate‚ÄîI'm told every day‚Äî I got a letter from a former constituent in Kansas saying, \"I want to sell property in California, put it in my business in Kansas.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't because the capital gains rate is too high.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to get the economy going.\n",
      "\n",
      "That will help Social Security.\n",
      "\n",
      "That will create more jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "That will help people who want to get off welfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's the American way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Senator Dole left the Senate, he and Mr. Gingrich also were recommending that we pass these tax cuts only insofar as we could pay for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent, but we have to prove we can pay for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "After he left the Senate, we abandoned that.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why most experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the deficit, raise interest rates, and weaken the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that will take away all the benefits of the tax cut with a weaker economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why we have to balance the budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'll tell you how I'm going to pay for anything I promise you, line by line.\n",
      "\n",
      "You should expect that from both of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer.\n",
      "\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "\n",

      "My name is Melissa Lydeana, and I'm a third-year student out at UC-San Diego.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I just want to say that it's a great honor representing the voices of America.\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, I think age is very‚Äîyou know, wisdom comes from age, experience, and intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you have some of each‚Äî and I have some age, some experience, some intelligence‚Äî[laughter]‚Äîthat adds up to wisdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it also is a strength; it's an advantage.\n",

      "Rudy Giuliani, the mayor of New York, brought crime down 25 percent just in New York City, but of course the President will take credit for that.\n",

      "My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans, went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next 6 years‚Äî a 50 percent increase; the highest appropriation ever, $6 billion for Pell grants.\n",

      "Very, very important.\n",

      "It's the age of his ideas that I question.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're almost not old enough to remember this, but we've tried this before, promising people an election-year tax cut that's not paid for‚Äî‚Äî\n",

      "Let's just take California.\n",

      "\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because we've had tough, aggressive trade policies, and because we got interest rates down, and we had a good, stable economic policy, because we've reduced the deficit 4 years in a row for the first time in the 20th century that a President's done that in all 4 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's why I don't want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can't pay for so your interest rates will go up and you'll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I say keep working on expanding the markets.\n",
      "\n",

      "What would you do if you were President?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, one thing I did was to oppose the Government takeover of health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody would have been forced into managed care.\n",
      "\n",
      "You couldn't have chosen your own doctor.\n",

      "\n",
      "Maybe that's part of the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it seems to me, if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, if we eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you've got to go somewhere else, then I think we've taken a giant step backward in the United States of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have the best health care delivery system in the world, and we want to keep it that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why we opposed the Government takeover health care plan that President Clinton tried and tried and tried to get through Congress.\n",

      "Didn't get it done.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a big, big mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, whether or not he'll do that again, I've heard some of the people say, \"Well, that's the model we ought to use.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, that's not a Government takeover, that's like the family and medical leave law.\n",
      "\n",
      "It just tries to set the rules of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm strongly in favor of a Federal bill to repeal the‚Äîany gag rules on providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we're saving money and depriving people of care, that's a bad thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor telling the patient, \"You need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure.\n",

      "\n",
      "And if we in fact are going to bring the country back together and be all faces around the table, the new American family, what do you see as something the President can do to begin that process to bring them back in?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, I think it's important to make voting more accessible.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why I strongly supported the motor voter law.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a big story, I think, in USA Today about the millions of people who've now registered because of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, several States now are letting people vote over 3 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of people are busy, and it's hard for them to just get there and vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform, because if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airwaves, because what drives the cost of a campaign are the costs of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you open the airwaves to more things like this‚Äîyou see, it's not just you that are participating here.\n",
      "\n",
      "For every one of you who stood up here and asked a question tonight, I promise you, there's 100,000 Americans that said, \"I wish I could have asked that question.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think we have to change the nature of politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last thing I think we should do is something I've been trying to do since I've been President, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country in Washington with more police on the street in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those are my best ideas about it.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Let me make one other suggestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you're a teacher, you can have an impact on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the things I think that really frustrates people is that so often, political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, there is a connection, and I think what we have to do is convince people there's a big difference.\n",

      "\n",
      "But these are important questions, and people have to decide.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that the American people also need to be a little more responsible and think about whether there's a connection in their lives and what we do in Washington.\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, we have in our economic pack individual retirement accounts where we think it'll encourage savings.\n",

      "\n",
      "We're doing that precisely.\n",

      "And I think one thing sooner or later we're going to have to consider is to take a look at the Social Security system, because we've got a lot of people advocating that, well, we don't want to put our money into Social Security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, you've got to be very careful about that, because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been looked‚Äîwhen I was chairman of the Finance Committee, which handles Social Security, we looked at all these options, and one thing we've got to make certain‚Äîwhen I used to go home, my mother would tell me, \"All I've got is my Social Security; don't touch it.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "And pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what is in my plan‚Äîand I think it's almost identical to what's in Senator Dole's plan‚Äîis we make more people than are now eligible to save in an IRA, and we'd let couples‚Äîmarried couples save more, and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to for medical emergencies or to buy a home or for an education, but they could also save to supplement their retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small-business people to take out 401(k) plans for themselves and their employees and then much easier for employees to carry it from job to job.\n",
      "\n",
      "My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman, and he told me last time he changed employers it took him 9 months to figure out how to transfer his 401(k) plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, none of that will happen anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so I hope that over the next 10 years you'll see a big increase in the percentage of people that have pension plans plus a secure Social Security System.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you say you're unemployed?\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing we ought to do is get you a job.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's the economic package again: Create jobs and opportunities, reduce the capital gains rate, reduce regulatory reform, stop some of this senseless litigation, and let people work in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think that's the thrust we will make.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, Social Security is a very important program.\n",

      "It'll be preserved‚ÄîDemocrats or Republicans.\n",
      "\n",
      "It'll be preserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline, just as we did back in 1983.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we did it on a bipartisan basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "We took it out of politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "People get so tired of politics.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "My question was how you plan to deal with the trade deficit with Japan?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me tell you what we have done.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have concluded with Japan 21, about to be 22 trade agreements now.\n",
      "\n",
      "And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded trade agreements, our exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last 4 years, and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until about 5 months ago, the Japanese economy was in a deep recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it'll go down more.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm very‚Äîthat's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're selling Japanese rice from California for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.\n",
      "\n",
      "I visited a Jeep plant, the oldest auto plant in America, in Toledo, Ohio, where they're going to export 41,000 right-hand-drive Jeeps this year, and they've got 700 new jobs because of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no easy way to do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you're dealing with an economy that's traditionally been more closed and one that's traditionally been more open, you just have to gut it out issue by issue by issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "We agreed in principle on our insurance agreement, and we're working on three or four other areas now.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the way you have to do it is make sure you're competitive‚Äîwe're the most competitive country in the world now‚Äîand then just fight to open those markets and go try to make the sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's what our trade ambassador, our Commerce Secretary, and all the other people in our administration have tried to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the bottom line is we've got to stop exporting jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to keep jobs here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said there are 357,000 good jobs, manufacturing jobs, which were lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I assume some of those because of our trading partners; we didn't have access to their markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ought to insist on access.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we don't have access to their markets the same way they have access to our markets, we ought to say, \"Wait, that's enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time out.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you give us access, we'll give you access.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's very hard to get into the Japanese market, as everybody knows.\n",
      "\n",
      "They want to get into our market.\n",
      "\n",
      "They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs‚Äîthose who sell exports.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it's very important to the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think we want to make certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I supported the President's trade policy, but we've got to be more aggressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you have a policy, then you've got to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy.\n",

      "\n",
      "We're the reform party, and we're going to make things better.\n",
      "\n",
      "And one of the things we're going to do is stop exporting jobs in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me say again, we've had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last 4 years, by far the largest number in American history, not just the big ones you've read about but a lot of smaller ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we're real good at and make sure we're getting a fair deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CD's and costing thousands of jobs in places like California.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we said, \"You know, if you want to keep doing business and selling your products over here, you're going to have to quit pirating our CD's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And they agreed to do a number of things and to let us verify that they'd done it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think they're going to make the problem much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is not a simple, easy answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "You just have to work on this day-in and day-out, every month, every year, every issue to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm proud that we're better off on that than we were 4 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer.\n",
      "\n",
      "All right, the next question is for Senator Dole, and it's in this section.\n",

      "Yes, sir.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hi, Ron.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q.\n",
      "\n",
      "This great Nation has been established by the Founding Fathers, who possessed very strong Christian beliefs and godly principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "If elected President of the United States, what could you do to return this Nation to these basic principles?\n",
      "\n",
      "And also, do you feel that the office of the President has the responsibility to set the role example to inspire our young people?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, no doubt about it, our Founding Fathers had a great deal of wisdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in addition to what you mentioned, they also were concerned about this all-powerful central Government in Washington, DC, that would in effect confiscate your property.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I carry around in my pocket‚ÄîI can't pull it out, I'd violate the rules‚Äîa copy of the 10th amendment, which says that we ought to return power to the States and power to the people‚Äîpeople here.\n",
      "\n",
      "You ought to make more decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honor, duty, and country: that's what America is all about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly the President of the United States, in the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlier‚Äîto everyone, by example.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you have 30-some in your administration who've either left or are being investigated or in jail or whatever, then you've got an ethical problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's public ethics‚ÄîI'm not talking about private, we're talking about public ethics‚Äîwhen you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who was a bouncer in a bar and hired as a security officer to collect files.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Watergate, I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are 900 sequestered in the White House‚Äî900‚Äî people like you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why should they be rifling through your files?\n",
      "\n",
      "So the President has a great responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it's one that I understand and would certainly carry out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the most religious great country in history, and yet, interestingly enough, we have the most religious freedom of any country in the world, including the freedom not to believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now we have all these people‚Äî just up the road in Los Angeles County we've got people from 150 different racial and ethnic groups, and they've got tons of different religions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the fundamental tenets of virtually every religion are the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what I've tried to do is to support policies that would respect religion, and then help parents inculcate those values to their children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me very briefly give you some examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which says the Government's got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I changed a Justice Department effort to get a church to pay back a man's tithe because he was bankrupt when he gave it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've supported character education programs in our schools, drug-free schools programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've supported giving parents a V-chip on their television so if they don't want their young kids to watch things they shouldn't watch, they wouldn't have to.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the kind of thing we need to do, give people like you and our families the power to give those values to our children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I think it's‚Äîyou know, before I came in tonight, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer because if it's God's will, whatever happens‚Äîif it's God's will, it will happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "A constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer in school in my view would be a great idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "I support it, and the President opposes it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, it seems to me the President, whoever the President may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "People look to the President of the United States more than any other person in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's the way it's always been, and that's the way it always will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer.\n",
      "\n",
      "All right, this is our last question.\n",
      "\n",
      "It goes to President Clinton, and it's from this section.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "President Clinton, perhaps you can help me with something tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've heard Mr. Dole say several times, \"all of us together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And when he was asked if he would support equal rights in employment for gay and lesbian people, you said that you favored that, and he said that he did not believe in special rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I thought the question was equal rights for all people, and I don't understand why people are using the term \"special rights\" when the question is equal rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could you help me in understanding that?\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to answer your question, but let me say one other thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "We don't need a constitutional amendment for kids to pray.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what I did was to have the Justice Department and the Education Department, for the first time ever, issue a set of guidelines that we gave to every school in America saying that children could not be interfered with in religious advocacy, when they were praying, when they were doing whatever they could do under the Constitution just because they were on a public school grounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think anyone who has experienced this would tell you that our administration has done more than any in 30 years to clarify the freedom of religion in the public square, including in the public schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wouldn't be fair for me to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would wind up‚ÄîI mean, it's the last question, and I'd mischaracterize it to try to make you happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me tell you what I feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people's decisions are wrong, even immoral.\n",
      "\n",
      "But under our Constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard, and you do what you are supposed to do, you're entitled to equal treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the way the system works.\n",
      "\n",
      "All over the world, people are being torn apart‚ÄîBosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi, you name it‚Äîbecause of all their differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "We still have some of that hatred inside us; you see it in the church burnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "And one of the things I've tried hardest to do is to tell the American people that we have to get beyond that, we have to understand that we're stronger when we unite around shared values instead of being divided by our differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lehrer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Dole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I hope I made my answer clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said I'm opposed to discrimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, we've suffered discrimination in the disability community.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are 43 million of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we want to end discrimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that answers itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "No discrimination in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've made that clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I would just say that it seems to me that that's the way it ought to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shouldn't discriminate‚Äîrace, color, whatever, lifestyle, disability.\n",
      "\n",

      "What we need is good, strong leadership going into the next century.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sorry we didn't have a foreign policy question, because just this week Secretary Christopher said, \"Well, we really didn't know much the first couple of years about foreign policy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that was quite an admission.\n",
      "\n",
      "It underscores what I had to say in the Hartford debate, that there is really no foreign policy in this administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's sort of ad hoc: \"Whatever comes up, we'll deal with it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, we didn't have more questions on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me say again, there is no more important responsibility for the President than to say, \"If you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, that's all we need to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you can be part of our America, and you can walk across that bridge to the 21st century with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And we are not well served when we attack each other in a kind of an ad hominem way.\n",

      "This is what it's all about.\n",

      "It's not about me.\n",

      "It's not about President Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's about the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's about selecting a President of the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we have our differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should have our differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mentioned other parties.\n",

      "\n",
      "If we all agreed, it'd be a pretty dull place.\n",

      "We should have more debates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe we'll have another debate on the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I would just say this: This is the highest honor that I have ever had in my life, to think that somebody from Russell, Kansas, somebody who grew up living in a basement apartment, somebody whose parents didn't finish high school, somebody who spent about 39 months in hospitals after World War II, somebody who uses a buttonhook every day to get dressed, somebody who understands that there are real Americans out there with real problems, whether soccer moms or the single parents or families working or seniors or people with disabilities, whoever it may be.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are some very fundamental differences in this campaign.\n",

      "President Clinton opposes term limits.\n",

      "\n",
      "But beyond that, we need to address the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I would just say, with my time running out here, it's a very proud moment for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what I want the voters to do is to make a decision.\n",
      "\n",

      "QUESTIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. ARMED FORCES\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. STONE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor, as you're well aware, the question of war and peace has emerged as a central issue in this campaign in the give-and-take of recent weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Carter's been criticized for responding late to aggressive Soviet impulses, for insufficient buildup of our Armed Forces, and a paralysis in dealing with Afghanistan and Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have been criticized for being all too quick to advocate the use of lots of muscle, military action, to deal with foreign crises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, what are the differences between the two of you on the uses of American military power?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what the differences might be, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do know what he has said about mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I believe, also that this meeting, this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, that we cannot shirk our responsibility as the leader of the Free World, because we're the only one that can do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us.\n",
      "\n",
      "And to maintain that peace requires strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can get into a war by letting events get out of hand, as they have in the last 3√Ç¬º years under the foreign policies of this administration of Mr. Carter's, until we're faced each time with a crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "And good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have seen four wars in my lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a father of sons; I have a grandson.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in Asia, or the muddy, bloody battlefields of Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stone, do you have a followup question for the Governor?\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. STONE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor, we've been hearing that the defense buildup that you would associate yourself with would cost tens of billions of dollars more than is now contemplated.\n",
      "\n",
      "In assuming that the American people are ready to bear this cost, they nevertheless keep asking the following question: How do you reconcile huge increases in military outlays with your promise of substantial tax cuts and of balancing the budget, which in this fiscal year, the one that just ended, ran more than $60 billion in the red?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stone, I have submitted an economic plan that I've worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country, all of whom approve it, and believe that over a 5-year projection, this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture, that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983, if not earlier, and that we can afford-along with the cuts that I have proposed in Government spending ‚Äî we can afford the tax cuts I have proposed ‚Äî and probably, mainly because Mr. Carter's economic policy has built into the next 5 years, and on beyond that, a tax increase that will be taking $86 billion more next year out of the people's pockets than was taken this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm only reducing the amount of the increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, what I'm talking about is not putting Government back to getting less money than Government's been getting, but simply cutting the increase in spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same question now goes to President Garter.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Carter, would you like to have the question repeated?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. STONE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, President Carter, the question of war and peace, a central issue in this campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "You've been criticized in the give-and-take for responding late to aggressive Soviet impulses, for an insufficient buildup of our Armed Forces, and a paralysis in dealing with Afghanistan and Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Reagan, on the other hand, has been criticized for being all too quick to advocate the use of lots of muscle, military action, to deal with foreign crises such as I mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, what are the differences between the two of you on the uses of American military power?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stone, I've had to make thousands of decisions since I've been President, serving in the Oval Office.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated 4 years ago against President Ford.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be neat and plausible ‚Äî and wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact is that this Nation, in the 8 years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37 percent, in all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I've been in office, we've had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but very effective increase in our commitment for defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what we've done is to use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Middle East, we've worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very good step forward for our Nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we've done in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are always troublespots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President, alone in that Oval Office, affects our Nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently by every President who serves.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's what I've tried to do, successfully, by keeping our country at peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stone, do you have a followup on ‚Äî\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. STONE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to be a little more specific on the use of military power, and let's talk about one area for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under what circumstances would you use military forces to deal with, for example, a shutoff of Persian Oil Gulf, if that should occur, or to counter Russian expansion beyond Afghanistan into either Iran or Pakistan?\n",
      "\n",
      "I ask this question in view of charges that we are woefully unprepared to project sustained ‚Äî and I emphasize the word \"sustained\" ‚Äî power in that part of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stone, in my State of the Union address earlier this year, I pointed out that any threat to the stability or security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, we've not had an adequate military presence in that region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we have two major carrier task forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have access to facilities in five different areas of that region.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we've made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our Nation be felt in a beneficial way.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, I believe, has assured that our interests will be protected in the Persian Gulf region, as we've done in the Middle East and throughout the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Reagan, you have a minute to comment or rebut.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, yes, I question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous administrations, in the preceding 8 years to this administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those 8 years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also would like to point out that Republican Presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both Houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Gerald Ford left a 5-year projected plan for a military buildup to restore our defenses, and President Garter's administration reduced that by 38 percent, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the B-1, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missiles, delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world ‚Äî which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one that is quick to look for use of force.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Carter, you have the last word on this question.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, there are various elements of defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope we'll get to later on, because that's the most important single issue in this campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think, habitually, Governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas, when I and my predecessors both Democrats and Republicans ‚Äî have advocated resolving those troubles and those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to that, the buildup of military forces is good for our country, because we've got to have military strength in order to preserve the peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, gentlemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next question is from Harry Ellis to President Carter.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE NATION'S ECONOMY\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. ELLIS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, when you were elected in 1976, the Consumer Price Index stood at 4.8 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "It now stands at more than 12 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps more significantly, the Nation's broader, underlying inflation rate has gone up from 7 to 9 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, a part of that was due to external factors beyond U.S. control, notably the more than doubling of oil prices by OPEC last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the United States remains vulnerable to such external shocks, can inflation in fact be controlled?\n",
      "\n",
      "If so, what measures would you pursue in a second term?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again it's important to put the situation into perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1974 we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had an even worse oil shock in 1979.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1974 we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recession that resulted this time was the briefest we've had since the Second World War.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we've brought down inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this year, the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure, brought about by the OPEC price increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "It averaged about 18 percent the first quarter of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most recent figures, the last 3 months, or the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7 percent ‚Äî still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs ‚Äî 9 million new jobs in the last 3 1/2 years ‚Äî that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30-percent inflation rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal ‚Äî and I quote them, I think-was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this Nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to add 9 million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with the energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ellis, do you have a followup question for Mr. Carter?\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. ELLIS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have mentioned the creation of 9 million new jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. ELLIS.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the unemployment rate still hangs high, as does the inflation rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I wonder, can you tell us what additional policies you would pursue in a second administration in order to try to bring down that inflation rate?\n",
      "\n",
      "And would it be an act of leadership to tell the American people they're going to have to sacrifice to adopt a leaner lifestyle for some time to come?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and they've done very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've had a 25-percent reduction since the first year I was in office.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, as I said earlier, we have added about 9 million net new jobs in that period of time ‚Äî a record never before achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One, conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well ‚Äî more coal this year than ever before in history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs ‚Äî about a million in the next 2 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has already passed the House; now has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the same question goes to Governor Reagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Reagan, would you like to have the question repeated?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, please.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. ELLIS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Reagan, during the past 4 years, the Consumer Price Index has risen from 4.8 percent to currently over 12 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "And perhaps more significantly, the Nation's broader, underlying rate of inflation has gone up from 7 to 9 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, a part of that has been due to external factors beyond U.S. control, and notably, the more than doubling of OPEC oil prices last year, which leads me to ask you whether, since the United States remains vulnerable to such external shocks, can inflation in fact be controlled?\n",
      "\n",
      "If so, specifically what measures would you pursue?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country, that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious, and it's dangerous to say this to the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8 percent, as you said.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is now running at 12.7 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that can't hide the fact that there are 8 million men and women out of work in America today, and 2 million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, he has blamed to the people for inflation, OPEC, he's blamed the Federal Reserve System, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less.\n",
      "\n",
      "We don't have inflation because the people are living too well.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have inflation because the Government is living too well.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see my time is running out here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll have to get this down very fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of Government to the place that we have balanced budgets and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in.\n",
      "\n",
      "And my economic plan calls for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we'll have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "A followup, Mr. Ellis?\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. ELLIS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, you have centered on cutting Government spending in what you have just said about your own policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have also said that you would increase defense spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, where would you cut Government spending if you were to increase defense spending and also cut taxes, so that, presumably, Federal revenues would shrink?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in Government.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a matter of fact, one of the Secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've had the General Accounting Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation, because I did it in California.\n",
      "\n",
      "And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned money to the people and reduced government spending.\n",

      "\n",
      "I noticed that his task force that's working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in the Wall Street Journal this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country which is typical of many Republican leaders in the past, but I think has been accentuated under Governor Reagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In California ‚Äî I'm surprised Governor Reagan brought this up ‚Äî he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that State under his administration.\n",
      "\n",

      "Yes.\n",

      "\n",
      "The size of government increased only onesixth in California of what it increased in proportion to population in Georgia.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President, why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way they'd like, and it isn't inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?\n",

      "MR. HILLIARD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Governor Reagan, the decline of our cities has been hastened by the continual rise in crime, strained race relations, the fall in the quality of public education, the persistence of abnormal poverty in a rich nation, and a decline in the services to the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "The signs seem to point toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment of a permanent underclass in the cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "What, specifically, would you do in the next 4 years to reverse this trend?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner-city areas, that in cooperation with local government and with National Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperation with the private sector, that we have development zones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The elements of government through these tax incentives for example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldn't be any loss to the city, because the city isn't getting any tax from that now.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people that would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government, and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because that wouldn't be costing Government anything either.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think there are things to do in this regard.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have to see it to believe it.\n",

      "\n",
      "There are whole blocks of land that are left bare, just bulldozed down flat, and nothing has been done.\n",

      "I know those things can grow out of despair in an inner city, when there's hopelessness at home, lack of work, and so forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I believe that all of us together ‚Äî and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was; it's a bully pulpit ‚Äî and I think that something can be done from there, because the goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us ‚Äî ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be ‚Äî that we will have total equal opportunity for all people.\n",

      "When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our Nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the Governors, and other interested officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has been a very successful effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's one of the main reasons that we've had such an increase in the number of people employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the 9 million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans and another million among those who speak Spanish.\n",

      "We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also are pursuing housing programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've had a 73-percent increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that had been deteriorating so rapidly in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've brought into the top levels of Government ‚Äî into the White House, into administrative offices of the executive branch, into the judicial system ‚Äî highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a younger man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",

      "A followup question?\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. HILLIARD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, President Carter, I'd like to repeat the same followup to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blacks and other nonwhites are increasing in numbers in our cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of them feel that they are facing a hostility from whites that prevents them from joining the economic mainstream of our society.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is racial confrontation in the schools, on jobs, and in housing, as nonwhites seek to reap the benefits of a free society.\n",

      "What is your assessment of the Nation's future in a multiracial society?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ours is a nation of refugees, a nation of immigrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes, which are being realized, for a better life, preserving their ethnic commitments, their family structures, their religious beliefs, preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries, but still forming themselves together in a very coherent society, which gives our Nation its strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous Presidents in the history of this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "To involve them in administration of government and a feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.\n",

      "Governor Reagan, you have a minute for rebuttal.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as Governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were public employment for these people who really want to get out into the private job market, where there are jobs with a future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the President spoke a moment ago about ‚Äî that I was against the minimum wage.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get.\n",
      "\n",
      "And indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therefore, I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56 percent.\n",

      "President Garter, you have the last word on this question.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it's obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have made good progress, and there's no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, welfare, national health insurance, those kinds of commitments that have typified the Democratic Party since ancient history in this country's political life are a very important element of the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them, which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown, central cities, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel-efficient, with a chance for a synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, gentlemen.\n",

      "INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM\n",
      "\n",
      "MS. WALTERS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, the eyes of the country tonight are on the hostages in Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realize this is a sensitive area, but the question of how we respond to acts of terrorism goes beyond this current crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other countries have policies that determine how they will respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israel, for example, considers hostages like soldiers and will not negotiate with terrorists.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the future, Mr. President, the country has the right to know, do you have a policy for dealing with terrorism wherever it might happen, and what have we learned from this experience in Iran that might cause us to do things differently if this or something similar happens again?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the We.\n",
      "\n",
      "stern world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years, in recent months, additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons in countries like Libya or Iraq.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have even alienated some of our closest trade partners, because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes a very disturbing comment that nonproliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when he was asked specifically, recently, about Iraq, he said there's nothing we can do about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it's part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Walters, a followup?\n",
      "\n",
      "MS. WALTERS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we are discussing policy, had Iran not taken American hostages, I assume that, in order to preserve our neutrality, we would have stopped the flow of spare parts and vital war materiels once war broke out between Iraq and Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we're offering to lift the ban on such goods if they let our people come home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doesn't this reward terrorism, compromise our neutrality, and possibly antagonize nations now friendly to us in the Middle East?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to Iran that might be of a warlike nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then and have consistently maintained since then that if the hostages are released safely, that we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns, which they have bought and paid for-also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you repeat the question now for Governor Reagan, please, Ms. Walters?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. WALTERS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor, the eyes of the country tonight remain on the hostages in Iran, but the question of how we respond to acts of terrorism goes beyond this current crisis.\n",
      "\n",

      "[Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this comes from an answer that I've made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question would be, \"Have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And I said, well, yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, \"What about this, what about that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, in which I would know all the options that were open to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have never answered the question, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second ‚Äî the one that says, \"Well, tell me, what are some of those ideas?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages.\n",
      "\n",
      "And sometimes, I think some of my ideas might involve quiet diplomacy, where you don't say in advance or say to anyone what it is you're thinking of doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your question is difficult to answer, because, in the situation right now, no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay, in any way, the return of those hostages if there is a chance of their coming home soon, or that might cause them harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families and that tragedy is over ‚Äî and we've endured this humiliation for just lacking 1 week of a year now ‚Äî then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they come home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about, what arrangements were made?\n",
      "\n",
      "And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.\n",

      "\n",
      "My question is not whether the Shah's regime was preferable to the Ayatollah's, but whether the United States has the power or the right to try to determine what form of government any country will have, and do we back unpopular regimes whose major merit is that they are friendly to the United States?\n",

      "And we've been guilty of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because someone didn't meet exactly our standards of human rights, even though they were an ally of ours, instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways, we have, in a number of instances, aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism, instead, for those people.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy when, at the same time, we're maintaining a detente with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all ‚Äî the Soviet Union.\n",

      "Now, there was a second phase in the Iranian affair in which we had something to do with that.\n",
      "\n",

      "I think I'm right, because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet buildup, which has been going forward at a rapid pace and for quite some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons, and his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-1 bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest that I have.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with 7 abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States-besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we're not equal in this treaty for one reason alone: Our B-52 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, I'd be glad to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation, unemployment, the cities-all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons, to negotiate with the Soviet Union ‚Äî balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has never supported any of those arms control agreements ‚Äî the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the antiballistic missile treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford ‚Äî and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a 7-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Senate has not voted yet on the strategic arms limitation treaty.\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been preliminary skirmishings in the committees of the Senate, but the treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "You've got 99 other Senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when a man who hopes to be President says, \"Take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation\" ‚Äî that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Reagan, you have an opportunity to rebut that.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, I'd like to respond very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, the Soviet Union ‚Äî if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been outnegotiated for quite a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military buildup in the history of man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, to suggest that because two Republican Presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty ‚Äî that puts them on its side ‚Äî I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90 percent of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to point out also that Senators like Henry Jackson and Hollings of South Carolina ‚Äî they are taking the lead in the fight against this particular treaty.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not talking of scrapping; I am talking of taking the treaty back and going back into negotiations.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Carter?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty ‚Äî and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form ‚Äî but he also advocates the possibility-he said it's been a missing element-of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race and insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own Nation as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "If President Brezhnev said, \"We will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American presidents over a 7-year period of time; we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations; and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations,\" it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans would reject such a proposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be very disturbing to American people.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would change the basic tone and commitment that our Nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with all Presidents, Democratic and Republican, and would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.\n",
      "\n",

      "I sometimes think he's like the witch doctor that gets mad when a good doctor comes along with a cure that'll work.\n",
      "\n",
      "My point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating.\n",
      "\n",
      "It does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States; it calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a new negotiation, because, as I say, President Ford was within about 10 percent of having a solution that could be acceptable.\n",

      "We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads.\n",

      "The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President, and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach.\n",

      "Yet U.S. dependence on Arab oil as a percentage of total imports is today much higher than it was at the time of the 1973 Arab oil embargo.\n",

      "And for some time to come, the loss of substantial amounts of Arab oil could plunge the U.S. into depression.\n",

      "\n",
      "Can the United States develop synthetic fuels and other alternative energy sources without damage to the environment, and will this process mean steadily higher fuel bills for American families?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I've had as a basic commitment since I've been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil: It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy, to stop the waste of energy, and secondly, to produce more American energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've been very successful in both cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by onethird.\n",
      "\n",
      "We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same day just a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our Nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the conventional kinds of American energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll produce more coal this year than any year in history.\n",

      "We're exporting more coal this year than any year in history.\n",

      "And we have an opportunity now, with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on the world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source.\n",
      "\n",
      "This exciting future will not only give us more energy security but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect.\n",

      "\n",
      "And the substantial loss of Arab oil could plunge the United States into depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question is whether the development of alternative energy sources, in order to reduce this dependence, can be done without damaging the environment, and will it mean for American families steadily higher fuel bills?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this Nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coal that the President mentioned: Yes, we have it, and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mines are closed down; there are 22,000 miners out of work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing is that we have only leased out and begun to explore 2 percent of our Outer Continental Shelf for oil, where it is believed by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy that there are vast supplies yet to be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were ‚Äî well, they were public lands subject to multiple-use exploration for minerals and so forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is believed that probably 70 percent of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there.\n",

      "Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal or to change substantially the windfall profits tax, to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies, to do away with the Department of Energy, to shortcircuit our synthetic fuels program, to put a minimal emphasis on solar power, to emphasize strongly nuclear powerplants as a major source of energy in the future.\n",

      "Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our Nation's history, the payroll tax increase for social security, which will only put a Band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on social security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.\n",

      "\n",
      "I noticed also in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making social security more sound by reducing the adjustments in social security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation.\n",

      "\n",
      "And although there was a serious threat to the social security system and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress, working with me, has been to put social security back on a sound financial basis.\n",

      "It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I don't believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they're paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out.\n",

      "Now, again this statement that somehow I wanted to destroy it, and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary social security, which would mean the ruin of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that a young man, orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for social security insurance, because she was not his mother.\n",

      "And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who's paying in should be able to name his own beneficiaries.\n",

      "\n",
      "I would like to make a change that discriminates in the regulations against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get.\n",

      "\n",
      "These constant suggestions that the basic social security system should be changed does cause concern and consternation among the aged of our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that social security benefits should not be taxed, and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which social security payments are made to the retired people.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also need to continue to index the social security payments so that if inflation rises, the social security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of the social security check continue intact.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, the relationship between social security and Medicare has been very important to provide some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this Nation against Medicare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease; an emphasis on outpatient care, not inpatient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care for those who are ill; an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the kind of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people.\n",

      "I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was opposing one piece of legislation as versus another.\n",

      "There is something else about social security ‚Äî of course, that doesn't come out of the payroll tax; it comes out of the general fund ‚Äî that something should be done about.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in social security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from social security every month while a State institution provides for all of their needs and their care.\n",

      "I think this debate on social security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies as vividly as any other subject tonight the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.\n",
      "\n",
      "The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this Nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic Presidents, in his acceptance address and otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican President, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, its good for the American people to remember there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues-also, between the two parties that we represent.\n",

      "When many voters go into that booth just a week from today, they will be voting their gut instinct about you men.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now would you please tell us for this your final question, why they should not vote for your opponent, why his Presidency could be harmful to the Nation and, having examined both your opponent's record and the man himself, tell us his greatest weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Laughter]\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, there's the historical perspective that I just described.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I've taken in the Oval Office the last 4 years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations that don't presently have it, particularly the terrorist nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he's been running for President ‚Äî I think since 1968 ‚Äî to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America ‚Äî this is typical of his longstanding inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way, in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara, would you repeat the question for Governor Reagan?\n",
      "\n",
      "MS. WALTERS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realizing that you may be equally reluctant to speak ill of your opponent, may I ask why people should not vote for your opponent, why his Presidency could be harmful to the Nation?\n",
      "\n",
      "And having examined both your opponent's record and the man himself, could you tell us his greatest weakness?\n",
      "\n",
      "GOVERNOR REAGAN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference-and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight ‚Äî that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program.\n",
      "\n",
      "I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers and autonomy and authority that belongs back at the State and local level ‚Äî it has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people ‚Äî and that there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn't be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index.\n",
      "\n",
      "He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5 under President Ford.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he said that no man with that size misery index had a right to seek reelection to the Presidency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20 percent, and I think this must suggest something.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when I have quoted a Democrat President, as the President says, I was a Democrat.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said many foolish things back in those days.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Laughter] But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democrat promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I don't think this can be better illustrated than in the case with guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our Nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women's rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governor Reagan and the new Republican Party has departed from this commitment ‚Äî a very severe blow to the opportunity for women finally to correct discrimination under which they have suffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a man and a woman do the same amount of work, a man gets paid a dollar; a woman only gets paid 59 cents.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for women by the Federal Government or by the State governments.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's all it says ‚Äî a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic Party and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the longstanding policy of his own party.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. SMITH.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands of unelected judges.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am for equal rights, and while you have been in office for 4 years, and not one single State ‚Äî and most of them have a majority of Democratic legislators has added to the ratification or voted to ratify the equal rights amendment.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I was Governor, more than 8 years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned, equal pay and so forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that if in all these years that we've spent trying to get the amendment, that we'd spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California ‚Äî and we were the first to do it.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I've been President now for almost 4 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've seen the strength of my Nation, and I've seen the crises that it approached in a tentative way.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the results of this debate indicate that that fact is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "I consider myself in the mainstream of my party.\n",
      "\n",
      "I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who've served before me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must have a society that's just and fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that since I've been in office, there've been six or eight areas of combat evolve in other parts of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I've learned in this last 3 1/2 years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the final judgment about the future of our Nation ‚Äî war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern ‚Äî has to be made by the man in the Oval Office.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open government, the job is a very gratifying one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this Nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a partnership involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "And our Nation, to stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in all other nations is my plan for the future.\n",

      "I'm sorry that we couldn't persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates.\n",
      "\n",
      "But still, it's good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Tuesday is election day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls; you'll stand there in the polling place and make a decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were 4 years ago?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was 4 years ago?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was 4 years ago?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were 4 years ago?\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to who you'll vote for.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last 4 years is what you would like to see us follow for the next 4, then I could suggest another choice that you have.\n",
      "\n",
      "This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity, with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing.\n",
      "\n",
      "We talk about the unemployment lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing 2 feet for each one of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this can be cured, and all of it can be solved.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous State in the Union if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world-I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this Nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know because we did it there.\n",
      "\n",
      "We cut the cost ‚Äî the increased cost of government-the increase in half over the 8 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits, and cuts to our people.\n",
      "\n",
      "We, as I've said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it would be one to take government off the backs of the great people of this country and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great.\n",
